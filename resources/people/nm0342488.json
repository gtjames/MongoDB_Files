{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"24 August 1988","placeOfBirth":" Stevenage, Hertfordshire, England, UK","birthName":"Rupert Alexander Lloyd Grint","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Rupert Alexander Lloyd Grint was born in Harlow, Essex, England, the elder son of Joanne (Parsons) and Nigel Grint, who dealt in memorabilia. The first of 5 children, Rupert has one brother and 3 sisters. His brother James was born when Rupert was a year old, Georgina and Samantha were born in 1993 and 1996 respectively, and last, but not least, Charlotte, who was born in 1999. Rupert grew up in Hertfordshire, the English county directly to the north of London, conveniently placed for commuting to Leavesden Film Studios. Before successfully auditioning for the Harry Potter films, Rupert attended Richard Hale Secondary School in Hertford: here he took an active interest in school plays, being cast as Rumplestilskin in the Brothers Grimm fairy tales. He was also a regular attendee at weekend drama classes at Top Hat Stage School, also in Hertford. Time at school was limited, as Rupert was needed on set for the Harry Potter films, where all of the child actors were tutored for four hours a day on set, to keep up with legal requirements. During the summer of 2004, he took his GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education) exams and completed his formal education.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3MDA3NjA1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDcyMDYzNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0342488","name":"Rupert Grint","idIMDB":"nm0342488","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Sick Note","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt5770788"},{"title":"Snatch","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt5992164"},{"title":"Tracey Ullman's Show","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt5337038"},{"title":"Moonwalkers","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2718440"},{"title":"Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt3731688"},{"title":"The Hogwarts Express","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt3638848"},{"title":"Postman Pat: The Movie","year":" 2014","remarks":["Josh (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2062622"},{"title":"Super Clyde","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt2708090"},{"title":"CBGB","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1786751"},{"title":"Underdogs","year":" 2013","remarks":["(English version, voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1634003"},{"title":"Charlie Countryman","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1196948"},{"title":"American Dad!","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0397306"},{"title":"Into the White","year":" 2012/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1876277"},{"title":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Video Game)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1680310"},{"title":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1201607"},{"title":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Video Game)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1571403"},{"title":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0926084"},{"title":"Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1756545"},{"title":"Wild Target","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1235189"},{"title":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0417741"},{"title":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","year":" 2009","remarks":["(Video Game)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1395738"},{"title":"Cherrybomb","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1248971"},{"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","year":" 2007","remarks":["(Video Game)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0944836"},{"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0373889"},{"title":"Driving Lessons","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0446687"},{"title":"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0330373"},{"title":"Happy Birthday, Peter Pan","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Special documentary)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0442675"},{"title":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0304141"},{"title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0295297"},{"title":"Thunderpants","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0283054"},{"title":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0241527"}]},{"section":"Producer","filmography":[{"title":"Snatch","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Series)","(executive producer -
