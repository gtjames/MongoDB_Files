{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"8 October 1969","placeOfBirth":" Saugus, California, USA","birthName":"Jeremy Davies Boring","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Jeremy Davies attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Pasadena, California. He made his film debut starring in David O. Russell's acclaimed first film, the Indy classic, \"Spanking the Monkey\", which became a surprise Sundance Film Festival winner, earning Jeremy an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Debut Performance. Davies' portrayal of Tom Hanks' interpreter, 'Private Upham', in Steven Spielberg's Academy Award winning film, \"Saving Private Ryan\" also earned him considerable critical acclaim and subsequent Oscar buzz. Davies' other film credits include Steven Soderbergh's \"Solaris\", with George Clooney and Viola Davis; \"Going All the Way\" with Ben Affleck; \"The Locusts\" with Vince Vaughn; Wim Wenders' \"Million Dollar Hotel\"; Lars von Trier's acclaimed avant-garde films, \"Dogville\" and \"Manderlay\" with Nicole Kidman and Stellan Skarsgard; \"Rescue Dawn\" with Christian Bale and Steve Zahn, and directed by the legendary Werner Herzog; \"Nell\" with Jodie Foster and Liam Neeson; \"Half Nelson\" writer/directors Ryan Fleck & Anna Boden's \"It's Kind of a Funny Story\"; \"Guncrazy\" with Drew Barrymore, and Jan de Bont's \"Twister\" with Phillip Seymour Hoffman. In television, Davies was invited to join the cast of JJ Abram's groundbreaking show, \"Lost\", and soon after, his character, 'Daniel Faraday', quickly became an integral part of the \"Lost\" mythology and a favorite of critics and fans (to the extent that ABC began selling Faraday bobbleheads). After \"Lost\", Davies joined Timothy Olyphant, Walton Goggins and Margo Martindale on Graham Yost's acclaimed, Emmy winning FX show, \"Justified\", based on a short story by the great Elmore Leonard. Wildly against his better judgment, Yost generously granted Jeremy unusual freedom to develop the character of Mags Bennett's middle son, and Davies' subsequent ferocious and fragile Richard the Third-esque portrayal of Harlan, Kentucky outlaw 'Dickie Bennett' was so far removed from 'Daniel Faraday', his work earned an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor. Davies' television work also includes the Emmy-honored HBO film, \"The Laramie Project\". Davies was raised without television, and experienced a vividly nomadic (non-military brat), low-income childhood, growing up throughout the US and abroad, including Vermont, Seattle, Oregon, Kansas, Michigan, New Orleans, Latin America, Canada, Denmark, Sweden and the Kingdom of California.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4MDMwOTQyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQxMzc0Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001111","name":"Jeremy Davies","idIMDB":"nm0001111","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Twin Peaks","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4093826"},{"title":"Justice League Dark","year":" 2017","remarks":["(Video)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2494376"},{"title":"Sleepy Hollow","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2647544"},{"title":"Lucifer","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4052886"},{"title":"Texas Rising","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3598496"},{"title":"Justified","year":" 2011-2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1489428"},{"title":"Constantine","year":" 2014-2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3489184"},{"title":"Hannibal","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2243973"},{"title":"Death and Taxes","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt2086824"},{"title":"Animal Love","year":" 2011/I","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1707312"},{"title":"It's Kind of a Funny Story","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0804497"},{"title":"Lost","year":" 2008-2010","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0411008"},{"title":"Rescue Dawn","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0462504"},{"title":"Manderlay","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0342735"},{"title":"Helter Skelter","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0383393"},{"title":"Dogville","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0276919"},{"title":"Solaris","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0307479"},{"title":"29 Palms","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0283090"},{"title":"Searching for Paradise","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0217787"},{"title":"Secretary","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0274812"},{"title":"The Laramie Project","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0257850"},{"title":"Teknolust","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0270688"},{"title":"Intimate Affairs","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0243991"},{"title":"CQ","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0254199"},{"title":"The Atlantis Conspiracy","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0253595"},{"title":"Up at the Villa","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0153464"},{"title":"The Million Dollar Hotel","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0120753"},{"title":"The Florentine","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0132164"},{"title":"Vorace","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0129332"},{"title":"Saving Private Ryan","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0120815"},{"title":"The Locusts","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0119557"},{"title":"Going All the Way","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0119209"},{"title":"Twister","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0117998"},{"title":"Nell","year":" 1994","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0110638"},{"title":"Spanking the Monkey","year":" 1994","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0111252"},{"title":"Melrose Place","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0103491"},{"title":"The Wonder Years","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0094582"},{"title":"Guncrazy","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0104377"},{"title":"1775","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0346456"},{"title":"Dream On","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098780"},{"title":"Shoot First: A Cop's Vengeance","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0102911"},{"title":"General Hospital","year":" 1963","remarks":["(TV Series)","Roger (1992)"],"imdbid":"tt0056758"}]},{"section":"Thanks","filmography":[{"title":"Lost: A Journey in Time","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(special thanks)"],"imdbid":"tt1436430"},{"title":"Lost: Destiny Calls","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(special thanks)"],"imdbid":"tt1371697"},{"title":"Dogville Confessions","year":" 2003","remarks":["(Documentary)","(thanks)"],"imdbid":"tt0357608"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Texas Rising: Capturing the Revolution -
