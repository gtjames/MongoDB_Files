{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"21 June 1965","placeOfBirth":" Chicago, Illinois, USA","birthName":"Laurence Wachowski","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"Lana Wachowski and her sister Lilly Wachowski, (also known as 'The Wachowskis') are the duo behind ground-breaking movies such as The Matrix (1999) and Cloud Atlas (2012). Born to mother Lynne, a nurse, and father Ron, a businessman of Polish descent, Wachowski grew up in Chicago and formed a tight creative relationship with her sister Lilly. After the siblings dropped out of college, they started a construction business and wrote screenplays. Their 1995 script, Assassins (1995), was made into a movie, leading to a Warner Bros contract. After that time, the Wachowskis devoted themselves to their movie careers. In 2012, during interviews for Cloud Atlas and in her acceptance speech for the Human Rights Campaign's Visibility Award, Lana spoke about her experience of being a transgender woman, sacrificing her much cherished anonymity out of a sense of responsibility. Lana is known to be extremely well-read, loves comic books and exploring ideas of imaginary worlds, and was inspired by Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) in creating Cloud Atlas.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzMTc2MDQ5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjkzNDY0OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0905154","name":"Lana Wachowski","idIMDB":"nm0905154","filmographies":[{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"Sense8","year":" ","remarks":["(TV Series)","(created by -
