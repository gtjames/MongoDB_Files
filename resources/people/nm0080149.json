{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"9 April 1948","placeOfBirth":" Jabalpur, Central Provinces and Berar, India","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"In April 1948 Jabalpur-based, Bengali-speaking Indira and Tarun Kumar Bhaduri were blessed with a child they named Jaya, and enrolled in the St. Joseph's Convent School in Bhopal. Her acting career started when she was 15 in a Bengali film Mahanagar. She became an actress in her own right in Bollywood after the release of Guddi. She went on to star in many Hindi language films, including blockbusters like Jawani Diwani, Uphaar, Anamika, Abhimaan, Sholay, Bawarchi, Chupke Chupke Zanjeer just to name a few. Her acting spanned from 1963 to 1981. She also wrote the script of Shahenshah. She married Amitabh Srivastav alias Bachchan, and subsequently gave birth to Shweta and Abhishek. Amitabh is the son of Sikh-Hindu parents, namely Teji and Harivansh Rai Srivastav alias Bachchan. Jaya quit acting after 1981. Then her married life faced considerable upheavals especially with the much-publicized affair of her husband with Bollywood actress, Rekha. Then their lives were disrupted when Amitabh was seriously injured by a blow from actor, Puneet Issar, while filming 'Coolie', which almost took his life. The family suffered another setback in 2005 when her asthmatic husband was admitted in Lilavati Hospital after complains of severe pains in his abdomen. Her husband did recover, and both husband, wife, Abhishek, and his new bride, continue to dominate Bollywood with their screen presence. Jaya has also received a number of awards recognizing her talents in Bollywood.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3NzU1MjA0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTQ0NzEz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0080149","name":"Jaya Bhaduri","idIMDB":"nm0080149","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Ki & Ka","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4744086"},{"title":"Irandam Ulagam","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3107246"},{"title":"Sunglass","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4249442"},{"title":"Ganga Devi","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3068260"},{"title":"Meherjaan","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1676134"},{"title":"Paa","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1532957"},{"title":"The Legend of Drona","year":" 2008","remarks":["Rani Jayati (as Jaya Bachchan)"],"imdbid":"tt1060249"},{"title":"Lovesongs: Yesterday, Today & Tomorrow","year":" 2008","remarks":["Mridula Chatterjee (as Jaya Bachchan)"],"imdbid":"tt1202528"},{"title":"Laaga Chunari Mein Daag: Journey of a Woman","year":" 2007","remarks":["(as Jaya Bachchan)"],"imdbid":"tt0985636"},{"title":"Kal Ho Naa Ho","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0347304"},{"title":"Desh","year":" 2002","remarks":["Suprabha Devi (as Jaya Bachchan)"],"imdbid":"tt0368683"},{"title":"Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe","year":" 2002","remarks":["Mansi Devi (as Jaya Bachchan)"],"imdbid":"tt0306840"},{"title":"Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...","year":" 2001","remarks":["Nandini Raichand (as Jaya Bachchan)"],"imdbid":"tt0248126"},{"title":"Daughters of This Century","year":" 2001","remarks":["Abhagi (as Jaya Bachchan)"],"imdbid":"tt0372854"},{"title":"Dr. Mukta","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0440335"},{"title":"Fiza","year":" 2000","remarks":["Mother Nishatbi (as Jaya Bachchan)"],"imdbid":"tt0248012"},{"title":"Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0178562"},{"title":"Akka","year":" 1994","remarks":["Special Appearance (Song)"],"imdbid":"tt0109069"},{"title":"Yeh Vaada Raha","year":" 1982","remarks":["Sunita Sikkan (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0397742"},{"title":"Silsila","year":" 1981","remarks":["Shobha Malhotra (as Jaya Bachchan)"],"imdbid":"tt0083081"},{"title":"Nauker","year":" 1979","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0079614"},{"title":"Ek Baap Chhe Bete","year":" 1978","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0409925"},{"title":"Abhi To Jee Lein","year":" 1977","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0178217"},{"title":"Sholay","year":" 1975","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0073707"},{"title":"Mili","year":" 1975","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0073391"},{"title":"Chupke Chupke","year":" 1975","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0072783"},{"title":"Dil Diwana","year":" 1974","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0155668"},{"title":"Doosri Sita","year":" 1974","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0357610"},{"title":"Naya Din Nai Raat","year":" 1974","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0156833"},{"title":"Kora Kagaz","year":" 1974","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0246740"},{"title":"Anamika","year":" 1973","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0069711"},{"title":"Gaai Aur Gori","year":" 1973","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0276150"},{"title":"Phagun","year":" 1973","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0070530"},{"title":"Abhimaan","year":" 1973","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0069671"},{"title":"Zanjeer","year":" 1973","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0070947"},{"title":"Annadata","year":" 1972","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0068215"},{"title":"Jai Jwala","year":" 1972","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0068756"},{"title":"Koshish","year":" 1972","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0215911"},{"title":"Samadhi","year":" 1972","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0284456"},{"title":"Shor","year":" 1972","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0234724"},{"title":"Parichay","year":" 1972","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0216067"},{"title":"Bansi Birju","year":" 1972","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0068255"},{"title":"Ek Nazar","year":" 1972","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0068532"},{"title":"Jawani Diwani","year":" 1972","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0155775"},{"title":"Bawarchi","year":" 1972","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0068257"},{"title":"Piya Ka Ghar","year":" 1972","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0158092"},{"title":"Dhanyee Meye","year":" 1971","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0243855"},{"title":"Jai Jawan Jai Makan","year":" 1971","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0155771"},{"title":"Uphaar","year":" 1971","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0166008"},{"title":"Aahat -
