{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"4 September 1978","placeOfBirth":" Jonesboro, Arkansas, USA","birthName":"Wesley Cook Bentley","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Wes Bentley is an American actor who first became well-known via his role in the Oscar-winning film American Beauty (1999), in which he played the soulful, artistic next-door neighbor Ricky Fitts. He also portrayed gamemaker Seneca Crane in The Hunger Games (2012), and co-stars in Lovelace (2013) as photographer Thomas. Wesley Cook Bentley was born September 4, 1978, in Jonesboro, Arkansas, to David and Cherie Bentley, two Methodist ministers. Wes joined older brothers Jamey and Philip, and was later joined by younger brother, Patrick. Wes attended Sylvan Hills High School in Sherwood, Arkansas, where he was in the drama club. Interest in acting came from Improv Comedy. He, his brother Patrick, his best friend Damien Bunting and other close friend Josh Cowdery developed an Improv group called B(3) + C. They regularly dominated competitions in Arkansas. He then placed First in the state of Arkansas in solo acting in 1996, his senior year of high school, Second in Duet, and also regularly won for Poetry and Prose Readings. Wes appeared on-stage quite a bit in Little Rock. At The Weekend Theater, Wes played the straight son of the gay couple in a production of La Cage aux Folles. At Murry's Dinner Playhouse, Wes' plays included Oliver. At his mother's urging, Wes attended Juilliard School in New York after high school graduation. He was there only a short time but appeared in stage work like Henry IV, Part 1 and The Weavers. Wes then worked at Blockbuster and was a waiter at TGI Friday's on Long Island. Wes has stated that his most prideful venture in life was starting a soccer team from scratch at his high school and subsequently putting together a full Conference, one of Arkansas's first. Wes had no real experience in soccer before doing this. Bentley made his onscreen debut in Jonathan Demme's Beloved (1998). Following his success in American Beauty, Bentley struggled with substance abuse, which cost him his first marriage, to actress Jennifer Quanz. Although he continued to land parts in films, including that of the primary antagonist in Ghost Rider (2007) and another major role in The Game of Their Lives (2005), Bentley has publicly admitted that during most of the 2000s he only took on acting roles to earn enough money to buy drugs. Bentley did not enter a 12-step program until 2009. He has stated that he considers his sobriety to be an ongoing process. Bentley is one of the main subjects featured in the documentary My Big Break (2009), which followed him and former roommates Chad Lindberg, Brad Rowe and Greg Fawcett as they struggle to find success within the film industry. In 2010, Bentley made his professional stage debut with Nina Arianda in David Ives's award-winning play \"Venus In Fur.\" Bentley has one child with his second wife, producer Jacqui Swedberg.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTgyOTY5OTA5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM1MjM1Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004747","name":"Wes Bentley","idIMDB":"nm0004747","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"American Horror Story","year":" 2014-2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1844624"},{"title":"Broken Vows","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3701714"},{"title":"Pete's Dragon","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2788732"},{"title":"We Are Your Friends","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3787590"},{"title":"Final Girl: La dernière proie","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2124787"},{"title":"Knight of Cups","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2101383"},{"title":"Open","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt2884502"},{"title":"Amnesiac","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2837336"},{"title":"Interstellar","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0816692"},{"title":"Welcome to Me","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2788716"},{"title":"Cesar Chavez","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1621046"},{"title":"After the Fall","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2815966"},{"title":"The Better Angels","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2316868"},{"title":"3 Nights in the Desert","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2123884"},{"title":"Pioneer","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2369205"},{"title":"Lovelace","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1426329"},{"title":"Hidden Moon","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1863268"},{"title":"The Time Being","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1916749"},{"title":"Hirokin: The Last Samurai","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1693679"},{"title":"The Hunger Games","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1392170"},{"title":"Gone","year":" 2012/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1838544"},{"title":"Rites of Passage","year":" 2012/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1745958"},{"title":"Underworld: Awakening","year":" 2012","remarks":["Antigen Scientist (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt1496025"},{"title":"Tilda","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt1663214"},{"title":"After-School Special","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1776052"},{"title":"Au prix du sang","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1316616"},{"title":"Jonah Hex","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1075747"},{"title":"The Tomb","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1038011"},{"title":"The Greims","year":" 2009","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1438257"},{"title":"La cadillac de Dolan","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0963965"},{"title":"The Last Word","year":" 2008/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0876233"},{"title":"P2","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0804516"},{"title":"The Ungodly","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0489318"},{"title":"Weirdsville","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0758798"},{"title":"Ghost Rider","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0259324"},{"title":"The Game of Their Lives","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0354595"},{"title":"The Four Feathers","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0240510"},{"title":"Soul Survivors","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0218619"},{"title":"The Claim","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0218378"},{"title":"The White River Kid","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0162766"},{"title":"American Beauty","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0169547"},{"title":"Beloved","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0120603"},{"title":"Three Below Zero","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0183885"},{"title":"Serendipity Lane","year":" 1995","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0903645"}]},{"section":"Producer","filmography":[{"title":"The Tomb","year":" 2009","remarks":["(co-executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt1038011"},{"title":"The Ungodly","year":" 2007","remarks":["(associate producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0489318"}]},{"section":"Soundtrack","filmography":[{"title":"Weirdsville","year":" 2007","remarks":["(performer: \"5th Night's Hallucination\")","/ (writer: \"5th Night's Hallucination\")"],"imdbid":"tt0758798"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Made in Hollywood","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0911896"},{"title":"21st Annual Critics' Choice Awards","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt5350078"},{"title":"How Zac Efron Learned to DJ","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt5602166"},{"title":"American Horror Story: Freak Show -
