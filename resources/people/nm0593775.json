His portrayals are so diverse and convincing that most people don't even realize that one actor could have played them all. He won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1940 for his role as the drunken Doc Boone in John Ford's Stagecoach (1939).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTcwNjAwMDI2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyNTUwOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0593775","name":"Thomas Mitchell","nicknames":["Tommy"],"idIMDB":"nm0593775","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Pocketful of Miracles","year":" 1961","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0055312"},{"title":"By Love Possessed","year":" 1961","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0054710"},{"title":"The Joke and the Valley","year":" 1961","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0595389"},{"title":"Adventures in Paradise","year":" 1961","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0052440"},{"title":"Zane Grey Theater","year":" 1958-1961","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0048916"},{"title":"Stagecoach West","year":" 1961","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0053537"},{"title":"The Islanders","year":" 1960","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0053511"},{"title":"The Right Man","year":" 1960","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt2439966"},{"title":"World Wide '60","year":" 1960","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2802990"},{"title":"The Untouchables","year":" 1960","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0052522"},{"title":"Too Young to Love","year":" 1960","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0053366"},{"title":"Sunday Showcase","year":" 1960","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0052512"},{"title":"Goodyear Theatre","year":" 1959","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0158413"},{"title":"Laramie","year":" 1959","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0052481"},{"title":"Glencannon","year":" 1959","remarks":["(TV Series)","/ Sgt.
