At 6'-1\", with knife-blade cheekbones, Bondurant, was \"discovered\" after a bout with cancer left her looking especially exotic and androgynous. She was soon a working model in the U.S. and Europe. A modeling trip to Los Angeles led to an acting career. She created a string of bizarre characters in TV and film - including Fight Club (with Ed Norton), Saturday Night Live (with Madonna and Mike Myers). She tossed around comedian Gene Wilder while playing Alice Cooper's favorite Dominatrix on the TV series Something Wilder. And on HBO's Arliss, she played a transvestite who lured a strait-laced athlete into a night of sin. In the indie feature, Donald and Dot Clock, her character bonded with a house-full of rodents. It's a career that prompted her New Orleans' grandmother to ask: \"Can't you play a normal person?\" Not likely. When The Hunger Games' director, Francis Lawrence, went looking for an actor to play Tigris, a pivotal character enhanced to be both female and feline, the search led them to Bondurant. Now the good people over at Lionsgate announced that actress Eugenie Bondurant has joined the cast of the fourth and final installment in The Hunger Games film saga The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2. She is also a cabaret singer, appearing in the American Songbook Series with Paul Wilborn and Blue Roses and a founder of The Radio Theater Project. A well-known On-Camera and Meisner acting coach, Bondurant, is a staff member at the prestigious Patel Conservatory in Tampa, Fl. Along with acting, she has a BA in Finance.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4OTEyMzkwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTc0ODczNzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0094163","name":"Eugenie Bondurant","idIMDB":"nm0094163","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"NCIS: New Orleans","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3560084"},{"title":"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1951266"},{"title":"Patsy","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1103248"},{"title":"The Year of Getting to Know Us","year":" 2008","remarks":["Strange Woman (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0924134"},{"title":"Elvis","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0437714"},{"title":"The Brooke Ellison Story","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Movie)","Patio Mom (as Eugene Boudurant)"],"imdbid":"tt0407612"},{"title":"Donald and Dot Clock Found Dead in Their Home","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0815877"},{"title":"Emperor: Battle for Dune","year":" 2002","remarks":["(Video Game)"],"imdbid":"tt0276104"},{"title":"Fight Club","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0137523"},{"title":"Sorority House Vampires","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0126714"},{"title":"Space Truckers","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0120199"},{"title":"Arli$$","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115101"},{"title":"Something Wilder","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0108934"},{"title":"Saints and Sinners","year":" 1994","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0117539"},{"title":"Frasier","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106004"},{"title":"Star Trek: The Next Generation","year":" 1992-1993","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0092455"},{"title":"Lady Boss","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0104539"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"The Hunger Games: Becoming Tigris","year":" 2016","remarks":["(Video documentary short)"],"imdbid":"tt5949958"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/15 01:47:19"}}
