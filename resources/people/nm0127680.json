{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"16 December 1969","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","bio":"The youngest daughter of jazz trumpeter Joe Cabot and singer/actress Cindy Lord, Christina was born in New York City and raised in an artistic household 20 miles north of the city. She attended New York University's prestigious Tisch School of the Arts, and while there trained with many renowned teachers (including Stella Adler), appeared in several Main Stage productions, and graduated with honors. Post-college, Christina studied acting with original Group Theater member Bobby Lewis, and Joan MacIntosh of the groundbreaking Performance Group. Although she began her career on stage, she now acts primarily on television and film, and splits her time between both coasts. In addition to her work as an actress, Christina is an acting coach for both children and adults.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzOTE2Nzg3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzA0NzQyNzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0127680","name":"Christina Cabot","nicknames":["Caputo","Cabbie","Cabnatchna"],"idIMDB":"nm0127680","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Pride and Glory","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0482572"},{"title":"The Incredible Hulk","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0800080"},{"title":"Tell Me You Love Me","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0809497"},{"title":"The Sopranos","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0141842"},{"title":"Down in the Valley","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0398027"},{"title":"Cold Case","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Series)","Louise (77)"],"imdbid":"tt0368479"},{"title":"Hostage","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0340163"},{"title":"Strong Medicine","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0252019"},{"title":"Six Feet Under","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0248654"},{"title":"The Maldonado Miracle","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0328097"},{"title":"Once and Again","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0202198"},{"title":"Dancing at the Blue Iguana","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0217355"},{"title":"The Prime Gig","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0223954"},{"title":"Man on the Moon","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0125664"},{"title":"Simpatico","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0174204"},{"title":"Fight Club","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0137523"},{"title":"The King of Queens","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0165581"},{"title":"The Secret Lives of Men","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0161189"},{"title":"Working","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0118517"}]},{"section":"Thanks","filmography":[{"title":"Kissing Jessica Stein","year":" 2001","remarks":["(special thanks)"],"imdbid":"tt0264761"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/15 01:58:46"}}
