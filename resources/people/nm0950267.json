{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"16 March 1906","placeOfBirth":" Whitechapel, London, England, UK","birthName":"Henry Youngman","height":"6' 3\" (1.91 m)","bio":"A career of seven decades of snappy, irreverent one-liners put Henry \"Henny\" Youngman at the top of most comedians' list of favorite showmen. Born in London, England, and moving to the United States when he was a baby, Youngman started his professional career as a printer in a small store. Naturally funny, he moonlighted in show business as the leader of a band called the \"Swanee Syncopaters.\" One night, the regular comedian didn't show up, and Youngman, who had tickled crowds with his jokes between musical sets, was asked to fill in. Some time later, established comedian Milton Berle stumbled upon Youngman's store and saw his \"Comedy Cards,\" a series of one-line gags that he had printed and were sold in his store. Berle liked what he read, and a lifelong friendship developed. Youngman, despite all the jokes about his wife, had a happy marriage that only ended when Sadie died in 1987. She supported him for years during the lean times, and he was always quick to let others know of his gratitude and devotion to her. Youngman's big break came when he was booked on the popular Kate Smith radio show in 1937. Never really making it in films, his nightclub career soared. His trademark, rapid-fire one-liners, with violin in hand, put him in a league of his own. In the 1960s, he enjoyed renewed popularity after appearances on the hip Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (1967). Youngman wrote a number of books comprised of his short jokes. The comedic legend died in 1998 at the age of 92 of complications from the flu.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNTA0MDQ0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk5ODAzOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0950267","name":"Henny Youngman","nicknames":["King of the One Liners"],"idIMDB":"nm0950267","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Eyes Beyond Seeing","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0192006"},{"title":"Here and Now","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0103440"},{"title":"Tiny Toon Adventures","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098929"},{"title":"Working It Out","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098952"},{"title":"Goodfellas","year":" 1990","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0099685"},{"title":"Norman's Corner","year":" 1987","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0458443"},{"title":"Movie Madness","year":" 1982","remarks":["Lawyer (\"Municipalians\")"],"imdbid":"tt0082799"},{"title":"History of the World: Part I","year":" 1981","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0082517"},{"title":"Silent Movie","year":" 1976","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0075222"},{"title":"Won Ton Ton: The Dog Who Saved Hollywood","year":" 1976","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0075436"},{"title":"Death Brings Roses","year":" 1975","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2321247"},{"title":"The Gore Gore Girls","year":" 1972","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0068649"},{"title":"The Corbett Follies","year":" 1969","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0297532"},{"title":"Batman","year":" 1968","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0059968"},{"title":"The United States Steel Hour","year":" 1961","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0045449"},{"title":"You Can't Run Away from It","year":" 1956","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0049973"},{"title":"The Henny and Rocky Show","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047737"},{"title":"A Wave, a WAC and a Marine","year":" 1944","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0037448"},{"title":"Love in Gloom","year":" 1941","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0292583"},{"title":"Television Highlights","year":" 1936","remarks":["(Short)","Television Salesman / M.C.
