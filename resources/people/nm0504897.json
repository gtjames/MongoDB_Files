He and his younger sister were raised by their mother after his father left them. In 1982, after passing the training courses of TVB, Tony became a TV actor and became famous for his comedy style in such TV shows as Lu ding ji (1983) or Jue dai shuang jiao (1979). However, he didn't limit himself to television and began showing his versatility in films like Sha shou hu die meng (1989) and La cité des douleurs (1989). After he starred in several movies directed by 'Kar wai Wong'; such as Chungking Express (1994) and Happy Together (1997), he gained more respect as an actor and finally received the Best Actor Award at the Cannes International Film Festival for his outstanding performance in In the Mood for Love (2000). In addition to his acting career, he is also known as a singer.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODYzNjYzMzk0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDUzMDU0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0504897","name":"Tony Leung Chiu-Wai","nicknames":["Short Tony"],"idIMDB":"nm0504897","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Monster Hunt 2","year":" 2018","remarks":["(as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt6170484"},{"title":"Europe Raiders","year":" 2017","remarks":["(as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt5827590"},{"title":"See You Tomorrow","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3824950"},{"title":"Hema Hema: Sing Me a Song While I Wait","year":" 2016","remarks":["Deer / Serene Mask (as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt5890038"},{"title":"La Nature Parle","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series short)"],"imdbid":"tt5786876"},{"title":"The Grandmaster","year":" 2013","remarks":["(as Tony Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt1462900"},{"title":"The Silent War","year":" 2012","remarks":["He Bing (as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt2078768"},{"title":"Le grand magicien","year":" 2011","remarks":["Chang Hsien (as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt1869721"},{"title":"Red Cliff II","year":" 2009","remarks":["(as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt1326972"},{"title":"Red Cliff","year":" 2008","remarks":["(as Tony Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0425637"},{"title":"Lust, Caution","year":" 2007","remarks":["(as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0808357"},{"title":"Confession of Pain","year":" 2006","remarks":["Detective Lau Ching Hei (as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0834902"},{"title":"Seoul Raiders","year":" 2005","remarks":["Lam (as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0455116"},{"title":"2046","year":" 2004","remarks":["(as Tony Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0212712"},{"title":"Dei ha tit","year":" 2003","remarks":["Ming (as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0395991"},{"title":"Infernal Affairs III","year":" 2003","remarks":["(as Tony Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0374339"},{"title":"Hung wun chiu yun","year":" 2003","remarks":["Lai Liu Po (as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0380069"},{"title":"1:99 Shorts","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt3998438"},{"title":"Infernal Affairs","year":" 2002","remarks":["(as Tony Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0338564"},{"title":"Hero","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0299977"},{"title":"Chinese Odyssey 2002","year":" 2002","remarks":["Li Yilong (as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0311913"},{"title":"Yau ching yam shui baau","year":" 2001","remarks":["Richard Ma (as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0338565"},{"title":"Fighting for Love","year":" 2001","remarks":["Tung-choi (as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0286623"},{"title":"Healing Hearts","year":" 2000","remarks":["Dr. Lawrence Ching (as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0266067"},{"title":"In the Mood for Love","year":" 2000","remarks":["(as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0118694"},{"title":"Tokyo Raiders","year":" 2000","remarks":["Lin (as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0233600"},{"title":"Gorgeous","year":" 1999","remarks":["Albert (as Tony Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0184526"},{"title":"Your Place or Mine","year":" 1998","remarks":["Wai (as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0178998"},{"title":"Les fleurs de Shanghai","year":" 1998","remarks":["Wang (as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0156587"},{"title":"Timeless Romance","year":" 1998","remarks":["Lau Yat Lo / (as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0163581"},{"title":"The Longest Nite","year":" 1998","remarks":["Sam (as Tony Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0168043"},{"title":"Chinese Midnight Express","year":" 1997","remarks":["Ahn (as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0154321"},{"title":"New Mad Mission","year":" 1997","remarks":["Chui Cheong / Drunk Gun (as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0184081"},{"title":"Happy Together","year":" 1997","remarks":["(as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0118845"},{"title":"Tou tou ai ni","year":" 1996","remarks":["Wing (as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0117948"},{"title":"Xong xing zi: Zhi jiang hu da feng bao","year":" 1996","remarks":["Hong Fei (as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0118118"},{"title":"Ming yat tin aai","year":" 1995","remarks":["(as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0121822"},{"title":"Cyclo","year":" 1995","remarks":["Poet (as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0112767"},{"title":"Jiu shi shen gun","year":" 1995","remarks":["Wong Tai-Fung (as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0116732"},{"title":"Doctor Mack","year":" 1995","remarks":["Dr. Lau Mack (as Tony Chiu Wai Leung)"],"imdbid":"tt0113672"},{"title":"Dak ging 90 III -
