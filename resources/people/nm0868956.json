{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"5 January 1969","placeOfBirth":" St. Louis, Missouri, USA","birthName":"Robert Torry","bio":"Guy Torry is a native of St. Louis, Missouri. Known as \"Torry\" by college friends, Guy attended Southeast Missouri State University, the alma mater of fellow comedian and St. Louisan, Cedric The Entertainer. His comic genius was evident to fellow students during these college years. Guy often held impromptu comedy \"slams\" in dorm breakrooms, leaving fellow students in stitches. Like his brother Joe, he left Missouri for Hollywood to find success in comedy and film. He actively supports his brother's \"Give Back The Love\" Foundation, a St Louis charity dedicated to helping disadvantaged children with basic needs such as clothes and school supplies.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NzU4MjEwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjg4NjA0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0868956","name":"Guy Torry","idIMDB":"nm0868956","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Civilian Life","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4245528"},{"title":"Happy Hour","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3095336"},{"title":"Axe to Grind","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1634275"},{"title":"Married, for Real?!","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3444098"},{"title":"Chocolate Coins","year":" 2013","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt3099188"},{"title":"Darnell Dawkins: Mouth Guitar Legend","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1568925"},{"title":"Screwball: The Ted Whitfield Story","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1262978"},{"title":"Flirt","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0756646"},{"title":"Dead & Deader","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0770739"},{"title":"The Last Stand","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0486611"},{"title":"Funny Money","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0244521"},{"title":"Diamond Life","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0975232"},{"title":"Midnight Clear","year":" 2005/I","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0451124"},{"title":"Slow Burn","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0376196"},{"title":"Blind Justice","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0424609"},{"title":"As Told by Ginger","year":" 2000-2004","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0235911"},{"title":"Runaway Jury","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0313542"},{"title":"Jonah","year":" 2003","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0487033"},{"title":"Tara","year":" 2003","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt0277370"},{"title":"With or Without You","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0346148"},{"title":"One on One","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0284770"},{"title":"The Shield","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0286486"},{"title":"Don't Say a Word","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0260866"},{"title":"Pearl Harbor","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0213149"},{"title":"The Animal","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0255798"},{"title":"NYPD Blue","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106079"},{"title":"Late Friday","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0272696"},{"title":"The X-Files","year":" 2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106179"},{"title":"The Strip","year":" 1999-2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0210456"},{"title":"Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child","year":" 2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0111996"},{"title":"The '70s","year":" 2000","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0224821"},{"title":"Introducing Dorothy Dandridge","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0172348"},{"title":"Trippin'","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0160298"},{"title":"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0103569"},{"title":"Life","year":" 1999/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0123964"},{"title":"American History X","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0120586"},{"title":"The Good News","year":" 1997-1998","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0122821"},{"title":"Ride","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0120707"},{"title":"One Eight Seven","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0118531"},{"title":"Back in Business","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0118668"},{"title":"Sparks","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115367"},{"title":"Sunset Park","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0117784"},{"title":"Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0116126"},{"title":"Martin","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0103488"},{"title":"Family Matters","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096579"}]},{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"Chocolate Coins","year":" 2013","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt3099188"},{"title":"Last Comic Standing","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series)","(writer -
