She spent 14 years based in New York City, playing leads in over 30 productions of plays by such noted writers as John Arden, Noël Coward, Emily Mann, Joe Orton, Sam Shepard, William Shakespeare, Jean Claude Van Italie, Eudora Welty and Tennessee Williams. She won a Drama Logue Award - Best Ensemble for the American Premier of Caryl Churchill's \"Three More Sleepless Nights\", played in the American premier of Judith Thompson's \"The Crackwalker\" and originated roles in Elia Kazan's \"The Chain\" and Arthur Miller's last play \"Finishing the Picture\". Besides working with Kazan and Miller, some of Ms. Fisher's more interesting theater experiences were creating roles from two great works of literature: George Orwell's \"1984\" and Victor Hugo's \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\". Ms. Fisher worked at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles alongside Annette Bening and Alfred Molina in Anton Chekhov's \"The Cherry Orchard\". Fisher starred in \"Sexy Laundry\" with Paul Ben-Victor at the Hayworth Theatre in Los Angeles. She studied with Stella Adler and became a lifetime member of the Actors Studio by actually \"walking up the stairs\" and auditioning for legendary acting teacher Lee Strasberg. Ms. Fisher recently completed The Host (2013), Love on the Run (2016), Red Wing (2013) and will work with Catherine Hardwicke in her new film Plush (2013) in August 2012. Ms. Fisher was honored for a Lifetime Achievement Award 2011 in her old hometown of the Pacific Palisades, California.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1NjU0ODU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzIwOTQ2MTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004920","name":"Frances
