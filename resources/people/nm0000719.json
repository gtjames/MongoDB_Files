{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"24 October 1939","placeOfBirth":" Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","birthName":"Murray Abraham","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"F. Murray Abraham was born on October 24, 1939 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and raised in El Paso, Texas. Primarily a stage actor, Abraham made his screen debut as an usher in the George C. Scott comedy They Might Be Giants (1971). By the mid-1970s, Murray had steady employment as an actor, doing commercials and voice-over work. He can be seen as one of the undercover police officers along with Al Pacino in Sidney Lumet's Serpico (1973), and in television roles including the villain in one third-season episode of Kojak (1973). He played a cabdriver in the theatrical version of The Prisoner of Second Avenue (1975), a mechanic in the theatrical version of The Sunshine Boys (1975), and a police officer in All the President's Men (1976). Despite these small roles, Abraham continued to do commercials and voice-over work for income. But in 1978, he decided to give them up. Frustrated with the lack of substantial roles, Abraham said, \"No one was taking my acting seriously. I figured if I didn't do it, then I'd have no right to the dreams I've always had.\" His wife, Kate Hannan, went to work as an assistant and Abraham became a \"house husband\". He described, \"I cooked and cleaned and took care of the kids. It was very rough on my macho idea of life. But it was the best thing that ever happened to me.\" Abraham appeared as drug dealer Omar Suárez alongside Pacino again in the gangster film Scarface (1983). He also gained visibility voicing a talking bunch of grapes in a series of television commercials for Fruit of the Loom underwear. Abraham won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as envious composer Antonio Salieri in Amadeus (1984), an award for which Tom Hulce, playing Mozart in that movie, had also been nominated. He also won a Golden Globe, among other awards, and his role in the film, directed by Milos Forman, is still his most iconic. After Amadeus, he next appeared in The Name of the Rose (1986), in which he played Bernardo Gui, nemesis to Sean Connery's William of Baskerville. In the DVD audio commentary, his director on the film, Jean-Jacques Annaud, described Abraham as an \"egomaniac\" on the set, who considered himself more important than Sean Connery, since Connery did not have an Oscar. That said, the film was a critical success. Abraham had tired of appearing as villains and wanted to return to his background in comedy, as he explained to People Weekly magazine in an interview he gave at the time of its release.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ2MzQ2ODYxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODY3NTIxNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000719","name":"F.
