{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"5 May 1922","placeOfBirth":" Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","birthName":"Joseph William Stefano","bio":"Creative horror screenwriter Joseph Stefano has been writing scripts since the early sixties. His first was The Black Orchid (1958). Less than a year later, he met his new friend, Alfred Hitchcock, to do the famous script for Psycho (1960). Stefano decided to drop the script for Hitchcock's The Birds (1963). Stefano later wrote a great screenplay for Eye of the Cat (1969) and, by the early 1970s, he did numerous Made for TV screenplays including Revenge! (1971), Home for the Holidays (1972) and Snowbeast (1977). When the 1980s came around, Stefano had no great tension to write any more scripts, and he was upset when Alfred Hitchcock died in 1980. It wasn't until around the early 1990s when he did the script for the last sequel in the Psycho series (he dropped the other scripts for II and III) - Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990). Stefano has won many Awards for his great scripts.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0825010","name":"Joseph Stefano","idIMDB":"nm0825010","filmographies":[{"section":"Miscellaneous Crew","filmography":[{"title":"Au-delà du réel -
