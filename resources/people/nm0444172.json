Their son Buster joined the act when he was only a few months old. The act was a rough-and-tumble one, with Buster being thrown around on stage most of the time. As the years went by, Joe Keaton became an alcoholic, which forced Buster to quit the act by the time he was a teenager. However, after he hit it big in silent film, Buster provided Joe with small parts in several movies. Myra and Joe split up long after Buster had become an adult. She'd had it with the constant verbal and physical abuse Joe put her through. He lived alone in a Hollywood hotel for many years and was said to have stopped drinking after becoming a Christian Scientist. Buster said Joe died as a result of being run over by a passing car.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0444172","name":"Joe Keaton","idIMDB":"nm0444172","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Palooka from Paducah","year":" 1935","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0026842"},{"title":"Evelyn Prentice","year":" 1934","remarks":["Undetermined Role (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0025091"},{"title":"The General","year":" 1926","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0017925"},{"title":"Go West","year":" 1925","remarks":["Man in Barber Shop (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0015863"},{"title":"Sherlock Jr.","year":" 1924","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0015324"},{"title":"Our Hospitality","year":" 1923","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0014341"},{"title":"Daydreams","year":" 1922","remarks":["(Short)","The Girls Father (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0013055"},{"title":"The Electric House","year":" 1922","remarks":["(Short)","Buster's Father in Prologue (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0013099"},{"title":"The Goat","year":" 1921","remarks":["(Short)","Minor Role (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0012224"},{"title":"Neighbors","year":" 1920","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0011508"},{"title":"The Scarecrow","year":" 1920","remarks":["(Short)","Farmer (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0011656"},{"title":"Convict 13","year":" 1920","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0011071"},{"title":"Good Night, Nurse!","year":" 1918","remarks":["(Short)","Man in Bandages (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0009123"},{"title":"The Bell Boy","year":" 1918","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0008874"},{"title":"Out West","year":" 1918","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0009466"},{"title":"A Country Hero","year":" 1917","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0007825"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/15 04:03:40"}}
