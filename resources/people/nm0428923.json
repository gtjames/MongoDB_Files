At 6' 11\" and 360 lbs., the giant Australian known as Megaman was an imposing sight and used his great size and strength to place high in the World Musclepower Championships. Unfortunately, tragedy struck Megaman in a qualifying heat for the 1995 World's Strongest Man Competition when he suffered a spiral fracture in his arm while arm wrestling European Champion and 1998 World's Strongest Man, Magnus Samuelsson of Sweden. Certainly a shame, as Nathan's career was only beginning and looking very bright.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTU4ODQzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTY4MjgyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0428923","name":"Nathan Jones","nicknames":["Megaman","Colossus","The Colossus of Boggo Road"],"idIMDB":"nm0428923","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Dark Ascension II: The Journey to Hell","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2215747"},{"title":"Dark Ascension","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1643249"},{"title":"The Tower","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3827668"},{"title":"A Flying Jatt","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5235880"},{"title":"Boar","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4158594"},{"title":"Never Back Down: No Surrender","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4790268"},{"title":"Boologam","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3557988"},{"title":"Mad Max: Fury Road","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1392190"},{"title":"Charlie's Farm","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3317874"},{"title":"Conan the Barbarian","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0816462"},{"title":"Muay Thai Giant","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1251761"},{"title":"Astérix aux jeux olympiques","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0463872"},{"title":"The Condemned","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0443473"},{"title":"Fearless","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0446059"},{"title":"The Protector","year":" 2005","remarks":["(as Nathan B.
