{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"19 August 1965","placeOfBirth":" Mamaroneck, New York, USA","birthName":"Kevin Brady Dillon","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Kevin Dillon, born in Mamaroneck, New York was known for playing tough guys and bad boys during his early career. His first major role was Rooney, the bully in the brilliant (though much understated) film Heaven Help Us. Kevin has since made many memorable film and television appearances, most notably in Oliver Stone's Platoon and The Doors, in the World War II film A Midnight Clear and in the cult classic The Blob. He was nominated for a Young Artist Award for his poignant performance opposite James Woods, Glenn Close and Mary Stuart Masterson in Immediate Family. Dillon starred opposite Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss in Wolfgang Petersen's Poseidon for Warner Brothers and opposite Lisa Kudrow, Emma Roberts and Don Cheadle in Hotel for Dogs for Dreamworks. Dillon is probably best known for his hilarious, yet heartfelt portrayal of the beloved character Johnny Drama on the hit series Entourage for HBO. His performance garnered him nominations for three Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award and three SAG Awards. He also recurred on both the critically acclaimed series NYPD Blue and 24. He will next be seen this Summer as Johnny Drama in the feature film Entourage for Warner Brothers, directed by Doug Ellin.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1Njg4NTEwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODU0ODcz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001143","name":"Kevin Dillon","idIMDB":"nm0001143","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Dirt","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5691084"},{"title":"TripTank","year":" 2015-2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2380303"},{"title":"Kevin Dillon: Virgin Mobile TVC","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt5364594"},{"title":"Entourage","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1674771"},{"title":"The Throwaways","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4076980"},{"title":"Compulsion","year":" 2013/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2381931"},{"title":"How to Be a Gentleman","year":" 2011-2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1839497"},{"title":"Entourage","year":" 2004-2011","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0387199"},{"title":"Hotel for Dogs","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0785006"},{"title":"Scarface: The World Is Yours","year":" 2006","remarks":["(Video Game)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0451192"},{"title":"Poseidon","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0409182"},{"title":"The Foursome","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0478802"},{"title":"Out for Blood","year":" 2004","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt0375562"},{"title":"Maple Ave","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4226992"},{"title":"Karen Sisco","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0364823"},{"title":"24","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0285331"},{"title":"That's Life","year":" 2000-2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0247136"},{"title":"Interstate 84","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0264710"},{"title":"NYPD Blue","year":" 1998-2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106079"},{"title":"St. Michael's Crossing","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0200165"},{"title":"Hidden Agenda","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0124743"},{"title":"Misbegotten","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0131484"},{"title":"Projet Médusa","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0130413"},{"title":"Stag","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0120192"},{"title":"Le lac Ontario","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0117309"},{"title":"Criminal Hearts","year":" 1996","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt0112739"},{"title":"Gone in the Night","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0116434"},{"title":"True Crime","year":" 1995","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt0114736"},{"title":"No Escape","year":" 1994","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0110678"},{"title":"Tales from the Crypt","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096708"},{"title":"Reporters dans l'enfer","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0104294"},{"title":"A Midnight Clear","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0102443"},{"title":"The Doors","year":" 1991","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0101761"},{"title":"When He's Not a Stranger","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0098636"},{"title":"Immediate Family","year":" 1989","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0097567"},{"title":"War Party","year":" 1988","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0098619"},{"title":"The Blob","year":" 1988","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0094761"},{"title":"The Rescue","year":" 1988","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0095981"},{"title":"Remote Control","year":" 1988","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0093843"},{"title":"Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam","year":" 1987","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)","Jack (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0092851"},{"title":"Platoon","year":" 1986","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0091763"},{"title":"The Delta Force","year":" 1986","remarks":["Delta Force member (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0090927"},{"title":"Heaven Help Us","year":" 1985","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0089264"},{"title":"No Big Deal","year":" 1983","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0086015"}]},{"section":"Soundtrack","filmography":[{"title":"Hotel for Dogs","year":" 2009","remarks":["(performer: \"Who Who Who\", \"Ruff Ruff Ruff\")"],"imdbid":"tt0785006"},{"title":"Entourage","year":" 2008","remarks":["(TV Series)","(performer -
