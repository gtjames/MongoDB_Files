{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"17 June 1874","placeOfBirth":" Columbus, Ohio, USA","birthName":"John Grant Mitchell Jr.","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"You would think stage and film veteran Grant Mitchell was born to play stern authoritarians; his father after all was General John Grant Mitchell. But Mitchell would actually be better known for his portrayals of harangued husbands, bemused dads and bilious executives in 30s and 40s films. Born in Columbus, Ohio and a Yale post graduate at Harvard Law, Mitchell gave up his law practice to become an actor and made his stage debut at age 27. He appeared in many leads on Broadway in such plays as \"It Pays to Advertise,\" \"The Champion,\" \"The Whole Town's Talking\" and \"The Baby Cyclone,\" the last of which was specially written for him by George M. Cohan (see \"Other Works\"). Mitchell's screen career officially got off the ground with the advent of sound, though he did show up in a couple of silents. The beefy, balding actor appeared primarily in \"B\" films, and actually had a rare lead in the totally forgotten Father Is a Prince (1940). From time to time, however, he enjoyed being a part of \"A\" quality classic films such as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), The Man Who Came to Dinner (1942), Laura (1944) and Arsenic and Old Lace (1944). Unmarried, he died at age 82 in 1957.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4MjYzODAyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDAxNDMxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0593372","name":"Grant Mitchell","idIMDB":"nm0593372","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Who Killed Doc Robbin?","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040966"},{"title":"Blondie's Anniversary","year":" 1947","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039201"},{"title":"The Corpse Came C.O.D.","year":" 1947","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039279"},{"title":"Honeymoon","year":" 1947","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039472"},{"title":"It Happened on Fifth Avenue","year":" 1947","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039502"},{"title":"Blondie's Holiday","year":" 1947","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039203"},{"title":"Easy to Wed","year":" 1946","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0038505"},{"title":"Cinderella Jones","year":" 1946","remarks":["(scenes deleted)"],"imdbid":"tt0038415"},{"title":"Colonel Effingham's Raid","year":" 1946","remarks":["Maj.
