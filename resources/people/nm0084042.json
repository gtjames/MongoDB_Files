{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"11 June 1932","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"George Victor Bishop","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Born as George Victor Bishop in 1932. He changed his name to Edward when he became a professional actor, as there was already an actor named George Bishop. Raised in Peekskill, New York through high school. Served in the US Army 1952-1954, worked as a disc jockey on Armed Forces Radio at St Johns' Newfoundland. Planned for a career in Business Administration and went back to school at Boston University. Decided he didn't like Business Administration and enrolled in Boston University Theater Division (1956). Graduated in 1960 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree. Won a scholarship to study drama at London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art in 1960. Started his professional acting career in July 1961. Married his second wife, the economist Hilary Preen at Caxton Hall in 1962. Met Hilary in Trafalgar Square when he was visiting places of interest in London. They had four children, who were born in 1964 (Daniel, who later died in a car crash), 1967 (Georgina), 1968 (Jessica) and 1971 (Serina). They lived in Napton on the Hill, a little village in Warwickshire, where he bought a large old house in 1980. Here he founded Napton Open Air Theatre and Napton Little Theatre, which staged high quality village productions. He later lived with his third wife, Jane Skinner, at East Molesey. Ed became a grandfather in 1994. He was a keen anti-war campaigner, addressing meetings in Manchester and attending demonstrations at arms fairs. He notably crashed one such fair dressed as General Pinochet, along with four other dictators that Britain had supplied arms to - and who had subsequently turned nasty: General Galtieri, Saddam Hussein, Adolf Hitler and Ivan the Terrible. It made the national news.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExODU3OTc5NTVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDYyOTY5MjEx._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0084042","name":"Ed Bishop","idIMDB":"nm0084042","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Hiroshima","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0475296"},{"title":"Waking the Dead","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0259733"},{"title":"500!","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0218803"},{"title":"The Unexpected Mrs. Pollifax","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0202045"},{"title":"The American","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0215514"},{"title":"The Demon Headmaster","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0194605"},{"title":"Highlander","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0103442"},{"title":"Broken Glass","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0115761"},{"title":"Funny Man","year":" 1994","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0109858"},{"title":"The Imaginatively Titled Punt & Dennis Show","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0108812"},{"title":"2point4 Children","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0101032"},{"title":"French and Saunders","year":" 1988-1993","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0092355"},{"title":"Young Indiana Jones","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0103586"},{"title":"Born to Ride","year":" 1991","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0101501"},{"title":"The Serpent of Death","year":" 1990","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0098293"},{"title":"Chancer","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098766"},{"title":"The Candy Show","year":" 1989","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0215591"},{"title":"After the War","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0278167"},{"title":"Testimony","year":" 1988","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0096250"},{"title":"Worlds Beyond","year":" 1988","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0174440"},{"title":"Les Girls","year":" 1988","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0313095"},{"title":"Judgement in Berlin","year":" 1988","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0095415"},{"title":"Whoops Apocalypse","year":" 1988","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0092211"},{"title":"The Two Ronnies","year":" 1987","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0066721"},{"title":"Turnaround","year":" 1987","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0092120"},{"title":"The Two Mrs. Grenvilles","year":" 1987","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0094199"},{"title":"The Kenny Everett Television Show","year":" 1983-1986","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0081883"},{"title":"Just Good Friends","year":" 1986","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0085040"},{"title":"Le cinquième missile","year":" 1986","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0091046"},{"title":"Restless Natives","year":" 1985","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0089904"},{"title":"Going for the Gold: The Bill Johnson Story","year":" 1985","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0089212"},{"title":"Chocky's Children","year":" 1985","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0426664"},{"title":"The Man from Moscow","year":" 1985","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0222652"},{"title":"Threads","year":" 1984","remarks":["(TV Movie)","US President (voice, uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0090163"},{"title":"The First Olympics: Athens 1896","year":" 1984","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0086713"},{"title":"Roger Waters: 5:01AM (The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Pt. 10)","year":" 1984","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt6243058"},{"title":"Master of the Game","year":" 1984","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0086755"},{"title":"The Master of Ballantrae","year":" 1984","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0087692"},{"title":"Bananarama: And That's Not All...
