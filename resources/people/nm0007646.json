He became one of the most famous impostors ever, claiming to have assumed no fewer than eight identities, including an airline pilot, a physician, a U.S. Bureau of Prisons agent, and a lawyer. He escaped from police custody twice (once from a taxiing airliner and once from a U.S. federal penitentiary), before he was 21 years old. He served less than five years in prison before starting to work for the federal government. He is currently a consultant and lecturer for the FBI academy and field offices. He also runs Abagnale & Associates, a financial fraud consultancy company.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3NTQzMDMwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDkyMjgz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007646","name":"Frank Abagnale Jr.","idIMDB":"nm0007646","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Catch Me If You Can","year":" 2002","remarks":["French Policeman (as Frank W.
