{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"25 July 1943","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Janet Natalie Margolin","bio":"Pretty, demure-looking Janet Margolin was born in New York City in 1943 and educated at the New York High School of Performing Arts. The long-haired brunette was discovered for films by director Frank Perry as she was making great strides as a teen on Broadway. He saw her in the play \"Daughter of Silence,\" for which she earned a Tony nomination, and took her immediately to Hollywood, casting her as the schizophrenic lass in David and Lisa (1962) opposite Keir Dullea. She bowled over the critics. The movie, which was praised for its handling of delicate, mature subject matter, should have paved the way to stardom for Janet but strangely didn't. She churned out uneventful second leads in such notable fare as Bus Riley's Back in Town (1965), The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965), and Nevada Smith (1966). Though she had better luck with her ingenue roles in Enter Laughing (1967) and Woody Allen's Take the Money and Run (1969), the offers starting drying up by decade's end and she turned to TV work. Woody used her again, albeit briefly, in Annie Hall (1977). After a brief first marriage, Janet met and married actor Ted Wass of TV's Soap (1977) and Blossom (1990) fame. Janet was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and died at age 50.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjQxNzkzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODMyMDMxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0546755","name":"Janet Margolin","idIMDB":"nm0546755","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Murder, She Wrote","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0086765"},{"title":"Murder C.O.D.","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0100202"},{"title":"Columbo","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1466074"},{"title":"Ghostbusters II","year":" 1989","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0097428"},{"title":"Distant Thunder","year":" 1988","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0095036"},{"title":"Tonight's the Night","year":" 1987","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0094163"},{"title":"The Plutonium Incident","year":" 1980","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0081347"},{"title":"Last Embrace","year":" 1979","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0079437"},{"title":"The Triangle Factory Fire Scandal","year":" 1979","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0080048"},{"title":"The Eddie Capra Mysteries","year":" 1978","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0077005"},{"title":"Starsky and Hutch","year":" 1977","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0072567"},{"title":"Sharon: Portrait of a Mistress","year":" 1977","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0076695"},{"title":"Murder in Peyton Place","year":" 1977","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0076425"},{"title":"Lanigan's Rabbi","year":" 1976-1977","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0075524"},{"title":"Martinelli, Outside Man","year":" 1977","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0075556"},{"title":"Annie Hall","year":" 1977","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0075686"},{"title":"Serpico","year":" 1976","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0074054"},{"title":"Joe Forrester","year":" 1976","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0072522"},{"title":"Police Story","year":" 1973-1975","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0069620"},{"title":"S.W.A.T.","year":" 1975","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0072560"},{"title":"Police Woman","year":" 1975","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0071034"},{"title":"The Wide World of Mystery","year":" 1975","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0202206"},{"title":"Lucas Tanner","year":" 1974","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0071008"},{"title":"Planet Earth","year":" 1974","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0072000"},{"title":"Pray for the Wildcats","year":" 1974","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0072024"},{"title":"Your Three Minutes Are Up","year":" 1973","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0070945"},{"title":"Family Flight","year":" 1972","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0068568"},{"title":"Mod Squad","year":" 1972","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0062589"},{"title":"Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law","year":" 1971","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0066696"},{"title":"The Last Child","year":" 1971","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0067326"},{"title":"The Interns","year":" 1971","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0065305"},{"title":"The Young Lawyers","year":" 1971","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0065357"},{"title":"Medical Center","year":" 1971","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0063928"},{"title":"Take the Money and Run","year":" 1969","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0065063"},{"title":"Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell","year":" 1968","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0062767"},{"title":"Coronet Blue","year":" 1967","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0061242"},{"title":"Enter Laughing","year":" 1967","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0061626"},{"title":"Ten Blocks on the Camino Real","year":" 1966","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0146308"},{"title":"Nevada Smith","year":" 1966","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0060748"},{"title":"The Eavesdropper","year":" 1966","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0058426"},{"title":"Morituri","year":" 1965","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0059470"},{"title":"Bus Riley's Back in Town","year":" 1965","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0058998"},{"title":"The Greatest Story Ever Told","year":" 1965","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0059245"},{"title":"Arrest and Trial","year":" 1964","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0056737"},{"title":"The Defenders","year":" 1963","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0054531"},{"title":"East Side/West Side","year":" 1963","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0056753"},{"title":"Alcoa Premiere","year":" 1962","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0054513"},{"title":"Ben Casey","year":" 1962","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0054519"},{"title":"David and Lisa","year":" 1962","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0055892"},{"title":"The Edge of Night","year":" 1961","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0048860"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/15 04:46:59"}}
