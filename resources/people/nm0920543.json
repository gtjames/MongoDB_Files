Several of his books have become best sellers and all have a mixture of comedy, drama and hard-hitting issues...the best-known being Trainspotting (1996) which was made into a box-office smash worldwide at the movies in 1996. Of his other works, one other has been brought to screen, The Acid House (1998)..a trilogy of stories and though not as successful as Trainspotting commercially, became a cult success in his homeland of Scotland and the UK. At time of writing, Welsh is currently on a project writing the sequel to Trainspotting called 'Porn', which given the success of the first film, should make him even more famous when released as a film within the next year or so.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTY2MDU4OTk3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTU4Mjg0NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0920543","name":"Irvine Welsh","idIMDB":"nm0920543","filmographies":[{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"T2 Trainspotting","year":" 2017","remarks":["(novel)"],"imdbid":"tt2763304"},{"title":"Filth","year":" 2013/I","remarks":["(novel)"],"imdbid":"tt1450321"},{"title":"The Magnificent Eleven","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1027873"},{"title":"Rachael","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt2190381"},{"title":"Ecstasy","year":" 2011/II","remarks":["(based on a book by)"],"imdbid":"tt1809287"},{"title":"Counterplay","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Short)","(novel)"],"imdbid":"tt5065696"},{"title":"Good Arrows","year":" 2009","remarks":["(written by)"],"imdbid":"tt1277947"},{"title":"Nuts","year":" 2007/I","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1170365"},{"title":"Wedding Belles","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(written by)"],"imdbid":"tt0984159"},{"title":"The South Bank Show","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)","(novel - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0077082"},{"title":"Bad Blood","year":" 2005","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0461010"},{"title":"Dose","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Short)","(story)"],"imdbid":"tt1285242"},{"title":"Dockers","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0206691"},{"title":"The Acid House","year":" 1998","remarks":["(screenplay)","/ (stories)"],"imdbid":"tt0122515"},{"title":"Trainspotting","year":" 1996","remarks":["(novel)"],"imdbid":"tt0117951"}]},{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"T2 Trainspotting","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2763304"},{"title":"Swung","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2243260"},{"title":"The Magnificent Eleven","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1027873"},{"title":"Trapped","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0929730"},{"title":"Nuts","year":" 2007/I","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1170365"},{"title":"The Acid House","year":" 1998","remarks":["Parkie (segment \"The Granton Star Cause\")"],"imdbid":"tt0122515"},{"title":"Trainspotting","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0117951"}]},{"section":"Producer","filmography":[{"title":"Filth","year":" 2013/I","remarks":["(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt1450321"},{"title":"The Magnificent Eleven","year":" 2012","remarks":["(consulting producer)"],"imdbid":"tt1027873"},{"title":"Good Arrows","year":" 2009","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt1277947"},{"title":"Wedding Belles","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(co-executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0984159"},{"title":"Dose","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Short)","(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt1285242"}]},{"section":"Director","filmography":[{"title":"Good Arrows","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1277947"},{"title":"The New Ten Commandments","year":" 2008","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt1483836"},{"title":"Nuts","year":" 2007/I","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1170365"}]},{"section":"Thanks","filmography":[{"title":"I Believe in Miracles","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Documentary)","(special thanks)"],"imdbid":"tt5098836"},{"title":"Kubricks","year":" 2013","remarks":["(special thanks)"],"imdbid":"tt2304717"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"How 2 Make a Film: Billion $ Weekend","year":" ","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt3748588"},{"title":"How to Sell a Film","year":" ","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt4814564"},{"title":"The Creation Myth","year":" ","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt4990710"},{"title":"Goodbye Britain?","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt5774932"},{"title":"The Safe House: A Decline of Ideas","year":" 2016","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt5772878"},{"title":"Antonia Bird: From EastEnders to Hollywood","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt5817052"},{"title":"Artsnight","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4544930"},{"title":"The 90s: Ten Years That Changed the World","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt4771588"},{"title":"The Wright Stuff","year":" 2008-2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0315727"},{"title":"Last Call with Carson Daly","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0305056"},{"title":"The Great British Break-Up?
