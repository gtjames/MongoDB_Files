{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"2 November 1952","placeOfBirth":" Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA","birthName":"Stanley David Andrews","bio":"David Andrews, born and raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, graduated summa cum-laude from Louisiana State University, before going on to study law at Duke University and earning his degree from Stanford Law School. After becoming a member of the California bar and practicing law for a short time, he took what he calls a \"hard right\", deciding to leave the legal profession for an acting career. Now a 35-year industry veteran, David Andrews has worked with some of Hollywood's top directors and Oscar-winning actors, and has been singled out by critics for his work on both stage and screen. A highly versatile actor and consummate professional, David's roles have run the gamut in films such as World War Z, Apollo 13, Fight Club, Hannibal, Walk to Remember, The Conspirator, Cherry 2000, and Fair Game, in which he was singled out for his powerful portrayal of Scooter Libby. On television, David has starred as a series regular on JAG, The Monroes, Mann & Machine, The Antagonist, HBO's 12 Miles of Bad Road, and the BBC's Pulaski, for which he received an ACE Award nomination for Best Actor in the title role. In addition to a very long list of guest starring roles, David has recurred on numerous series: Netflix' hit series House of Cards, Justified, Murder in the First, The Catch, Crisis, The Whispers, Necessary Roughness, CSI, Covert Affairs, Brothers and Sisters, Surface, Dragnet, and Murder One. He is currently recurring as Sam Vincent on USA's soon-to-be released series Shooter. MOW/mini-series projects, to name just a few, include HBO's Band of Brothers and From the Earth to the Moon, for which he earned a SAG Award for Outstanding Ensemble Performance and critical acclaim for his performance as astronaut Frank Borman. David recently finished co-writing his second feature film script, Bushido, a action/adventure tale of self discovery set in Japan amidst the chaos and destruction of the final days of WWII.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzODM0OTQxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMyNTQ5NjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0028625","name":"David
