{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"17 March 1961","placeOfBirth":" Chicago, Illinois, USA","birthName":"Kazimierz A. Siemaszko","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Casey Siemaszko is an extremely versatile American actor, known for his roles in the 1980s 'Brat Pack' films, although over the last three decades he has notched up an impressive 60 plus Film and TV appearances. Siemaszko was born in Chicago, Illinois, to a Polish father and a British mother. His sister is actress Nina Siemaszko. His first film role was in the Rob Lowe vehicle Class (1983), which also featured John Cusack, Andrew McCarthy, and Alan Ruck. He appeared with Charlie Sheen and Chad Lowe in Silence of the Heart (1984) and the following year in both Secret Admirer (1985) with C. Thomas Howell and Back to the Future (1985) with Michael J. Fox. The second half of the 1980s showed no break from the 'Brat Pack'. Indeed, Casey took a role in the Stephen King-adapted and Rob Reiner-directed Stand by Me (1986) in which he appeared alongside John Cusack, Corey Feldman, River Phoenix, Kiefer Sutherlandand Wil Wheaton. He gain appeared with Kiefer Sutherland that same year in Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories (1985). A substantial role came with the Matthew Broderick comedy Biloxi Blues (1988) and he reprised his role as 3-D in the sequel, Back to the Future Part II (1989). He saw the 1980s out with a starring role in the Brat Pack blockbuster Young Guns (1988) alongside Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, and Lou Diamond Phillips. Casey has added a string of quality movies to his resume, including a great performance in Of Mice and Men (1992) directed by - and starring - Gary Sinise, and based on the acclaimed novel by John Steinbeck. It seems he has left the 'Brat Pack' long behind, but nobody can deny the top notch performances he put into these great movies. In 2009 he appeared in the Michael Mann film Public Enemies (2009). Casey starred in the Rob Lowe film Killing Kennedy (2013).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ1MTAxNzIyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDA2ODczMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0797150","name":"Casey
