He has made several well-known music videos, including the video for \"Runaway Train\" by Soul Asylum, which won a Grammy Award, \"Dani California\" by Red Hot Chili Peppers, \"What God Wants\" by Roger Waters, and \"Help Me\" and \"God's Gonna Cut You Down\" by Johnny Cash. Kaye is a six time Grammy nominated music video director. His feature film debut was American History X (1998), a drama about racism starring Edward Norton and Edward Furlong. Kaye disowned the final cut of the film, as he did not approve of its quality. He unsuccessfully attempted to have his name removed from the credits. The final cut was critically lauded and Norton was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film. Kaye's second feature, a documentary called Lake of Fire, was about the abortion debate in the United States. It opened in Toronto in September 2006. The movie was shortlisted for an Oscar, nominated for Best Documentary Film at the Independent Spirit Awards, the Chicago Film Critics Association Awards, and the Satellite Awards. Lake of Fire took Kaye 18 years to make. Kaye's third feature film, Black Water Transit (2010), starred Laurence Fishburne, Karl Urban, Evan Ross, Brittany Snow, and Stephen Dorff. The film is unfinished as the production company went bankrupt during the making. Kaye's fourth feature film, Detachment (2011), starring his daughter Betty Kaye, is a drama about the decline of the education system in American high schools.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTc2NzQzMzMxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ2Mjk4NDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0443411","name":"Tony Kaye","idIMDB":"nm0443411","filmographies":[{"section":"Director","filmography":[{"title":"Humpty Dumpty","year":" ","remarks":["(Video documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt6049328"},{"title":"Made for You","year":" 2013","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt2751128"},{"title":"Rituals","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)","(1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt2402857"},{"title":"Detachment","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1683526"},{"title":"Black Water Transit","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0490087"},{"title":"This Is Not Sex","year":" 2008","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt3010368"},{"title":"Lobby Lobster","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0863087"},{"title":"Lake of Fire","year":" 2006","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0841119"},{"title":"Johnny Cash: God's Gonna Cut You Down","year":" 2006","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt4530638"},{"title":"Lying for a Living","year":" 2002","remarks":["(Video documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt4800292"},{"title":"American History X","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0120586"},{"title":"Tony Kaye's Documentary","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0237986"},{"title":"Roger Waters: Three Wishes","year":" 1993","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt6263796"},{"title":"Soul Asylum: Runaway Train","year":" 1993","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt4649090"},{"title":"Roger Waters: What God Wants, Part 1","year":" 1992","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt6263734"}]},{"section":"Producer","filmography":[{"title":"Madness","year":" 2009","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0903631"},{"title":"Lobby Lobster","year":" 2007","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0863087"},{"title":"Lake of Fire","year":" 2006","remarks":["(Documentary)","(executive producer)","/ (producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0841119"},{"title":"Roger Waters: What God Wants, Part 1","year":" 1992","remarks":["(Video short)","(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt6263734"}]},{"section":"Cinematographer","filmography":[{"title":"Made for You","year":" 2013","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt2751128"},{"title":"Detachment","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1683526"},{"title":"Black Water Transit","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0490087"},{"title":"This Is Not Sex","year":" 2008","remarks":["(Short)","(director of photography)"],"imdbid":"tt3010368"},{"title":"Lobby Lobster","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0863087"},{"title":"Lake of Fire","year":" 2006","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0841119"},{"title":"American History X","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0120586"},{"title":"Tony Kaye's Documentary","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0237986"}]},{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"Lake of Fire","year":" 2006","remarks":["(Documentary)","(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0841119"}]},{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Spun","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0283003"}]},{"section":"Camera and Electrical Department","filmography":[{"title":"American History X","year":" 1998","remarks":["(camera operator -
