She graduated from Drama Centre London with a First Class BA (Hons) in 2005 and her first job was with Declan Donellan in 'Great Expectations' at the Royal Shakespeare Company that autumn. She then went on to work in regional theatre, world tours and the West End. Her striking appearance motivated photographer Polly Borland to collaborate with her as the subject of a noted series of photographs. In 2011 Gwendoline was cast in the role of Brienne of Tarth in the successful HBO TV adaptation Game of Thrones (2011). She plays the role of Commander Lyme in the last two Hunger Games movies: The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 (2014) and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015). She has also been cast as Captain Phasma in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) and Absolutely Fabulous:The Movie (2016). Gwendoline is the face of the Vivienne Westwood A/W 2015 campaign.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA3MTcxMTMzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDI2MDg0Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3729225","name":"Gwendoline Christie","idIMDB":"nm3729225","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Star Wars: Episode VIII","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2527336"},{"title":"Game of Thrones","year":" 2012-2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0944947"},{"title":"Top of the Lake","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2103085"},{"title":"Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2112096"},{"title":"Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens","year":" 2016","remarks":["(Video Game)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt5430544"},{"title":"Star Wars: The Force Awakens","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2488496"},{"title":"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1951266"},{"title":"Wizards vs. Aliens","year":" 2012-2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2491332"},{"title":"The Zero Theorem","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2333804"},{"title":"Ourhouse, Episode 1: 'Games'","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt5926666"},{"title":"The 7 Ages of Britain Teaser","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Short)"],"imdbid":"tt2022544"},{"title":"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1054606"},{"title":"The Time Surgeon","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2022573"}]},{"section":"Soundtrack","filmography":[{"title":"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)","(performer - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt3444938"}]},{"section":"Thanks","filmography":[{"title":"Seven Ages of Britain","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)","(thanks - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt1415248"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Secrets of the Force Awakens: A Cinematic Journey","year":" 2016","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt5532610"},{"title":"E!
