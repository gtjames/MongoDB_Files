{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"16 December 1934","placeOfBirth":" Canton, Ohio, USA","birthName":"Paul Richard Schrum","bio":"Attending a catholic school, Peter \"Pete\" Schrum realized that he wanted to be an actor. Born in 1934, Peter started doing play acting and drama all over the place. He was enthused to work and loved doing stage. He and lifelong friends vowed to become actors one day. Peter was the only one to uphold the promise. Every so often, Peter would be out of work and laugh about some of his characters. Most memorable for playing the shotgun-firing bartender, Lloyd, in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). Schrum took up the job of the Coca-Cola Santa Claus, then stopped working for years. Pete's last film, Hulk (2003) was released in mid 2003. You can spot him as Sgt. Crowe.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjI2ZjhhNGQtMTZkNi00NWVjLTliMDEtMThiNjQ5MzkwMWY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyNDQ2NjI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0775623","name":"Peter Schrum","nicknames":["Pig-iron Pete"],"idIMDB":"nm0775623","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"The Man Who Wasn't There","year":" 2001","remarks":["Truck Driver (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0243133"},{"title":"Dead Man","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0112817"},{"title":"Legend","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0112045"},{"title":"Herman's Head","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0101115"},{"title":"Quantum Leap","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096684"},{"title":"Demonic Toys","year":" 1992","remarks":["(Video)","Charnetski (as Pete Schrum)"],"imdbid":"tt0104083"},{"title":"Terminator 2: Judgment Day","year":" 1991","remarks":["(as Pete Schrum)"],"imdbid":"tt0103064"},{"title":"True Colors","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098933"},{"title":"Blue Desert","year":" 1991","remarks":["Burly Man (as Pete Schrum)"],"imdbid":"tt0101486"},{"title":"Father Dowling Mysteries","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096582"},{"title":"Night Court","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0086770"},{"title":"Chip 'n' Dale Rescue Rangers","year":" 1989-1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096557"},{"title":"Arena","year":" 1989","remarks":["Additional Voices (voice, as Pete Schrum)"],"imdbid":"tt0101366"},{"title":"Valerie's Family: The Hogans","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0090540"},{"title":"The Night Before","year":" 1988","remarks":["Fat Jack (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0095730"},{"title":"Family Ties","year":" 1987","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0083413"},{"title":"Flicks","year":" 1987","remarks":["Narrator (segment 'New Adventures of the Great Galaxy')","/ Reginald Harcroft IV (segment \"Whodunit\")","(as Pete Schrum)"],"imdbid":"tt0093033"},{"title":"Hollywood Harry","year":" 1986","remarks":["Clapper (as Pete Schrum)"],"imdbid":"tt0089287"},{"title":"Eliminators","year":" 1986","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0091003"},{"title":"It's Your Move","year":" 1985","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0086737"},{"title":"Trancers","year":" 1984","remarks":["(as Pete Schrum)"],"imdbid":"tt0090192"},{"title":"Silver Spoons","year":" 1984","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0083479"},{"title":"After MASH","year":" 1984","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0084969"},{"title":"T.J.
