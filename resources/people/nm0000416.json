{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"22 November 1940","placeOfBirth":" Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","birthName":"Terence Vance Gilliam","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Terry Gilliam was born in Minnesota near Medicine Lake. When he was 12 his family moved to Los Angeles where he became a fan of Mad magazine. In his early 20's he was often stopped by the police who often suspected him of being a drug addict and Gilliam had to explain that he worked in advertising. Gilliam said these experiences made him understand how it was like to be Black or Mexican and gave him sympathy for the poor. In the political turmoil in the 60's, Gilliam feared he might develop into a terrorist and decided to leave the USA. After moving to England he landed a job on the children's television show Do Not Adjust Your Set as an animator. There he would meet his future collaborators in Monty Python: Terry Jones, Eric Idle and Michael Palin. In 2006 he renounced his American citizenship.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODAyMDM0NjEwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUyMDY5Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000416","name":"Terry Gilliam","nicknames":["Captain Chaos"],"idIMDB":"nm0000416","filmographies":[{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote","year":" 2018","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt1318517"},{"title":"Monty Python Live (Mostly)","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3872778"},{"title":"The Zero Theorem","year":" 2013","remarks":["(additional dialogue)"],"imdbid":"tt2333804"},{"title":"The Wholly Family","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1852145"},{"title":"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus","year":" 2009","remarks":["(written by)"],"imdbid":"tt1054606"},{"title":"Tideland","year":" 2005","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0410764"},{"title":"Eric Idle: Exploits Monty Python","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1619024"},{"title":"Python Night: 30 Years of Monty Python","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0220292"},{"title":"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas","year":" 1998","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0120669"},{"title":"Monty Python & the Quest for the Holy Grail","year":" 1996","remarks":["(Video Game)","(screenplay \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\")"],"imdbid":"tt0151625"},{"title":"Parrot Sketch Not Included: Twenty Years of Monty Python","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Special)","(sketches)"],"imdbid":"tt0213984"},{"title":"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen","year":" 1988","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0096764"},{"title":"Brazil","year":" 1985","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0088846"},{"title":"The Crimson Permanent Assurance","year":" 1983","remarks":["(Short)","(written by)"],"imdbid":"tt0215685"},{"title":"The Meaning of Life","year":" 1983","remarks":["(written by)"],"imdbid":"tt0085959"},{"title":"Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl","year":" 1982","remarks":["(Documentary)","(written by)"],"imdbid":"tt0084352"},{"title":"Time Bandits","year":" 1981","remarks":["(written by)"],"imdbid":"tt0081633"},{"title":"Life of Brian","year":" 1979","remarks":["(written by)"],"imdbid":"tt0079470"},{"title":"Jabberwocky","year":" 1977","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0076221"},{"title":"Miracle of Flight","year":" 1975","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0344070"},{"title":"Monty Python and the Holy Grail","year":" 1975","remarks":["(written by)"],"imdbid":"tt0071853"},{"title":"Monty Python's Flying Circus","year":" ","remarks":["(TV Series)","(written by - 41 episodes, 1969 - 1974)","(creator - 1 episode, 1973)","(additional material - 1 episode, 1969)","(conceived and written by - 1 episode, 1969)"],"imdbid":"tt0063929"},{"title":"Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus","year":" 1972","remarks":["(TV Series)","(written by)"],"imdbid":"tt0202477"},{"title":"And Now for Something Completely Different","year":" 1971","remarks":["(screen foreplay & conception)"],"imdbid":"tt0066765"},{"title":"Broaden Your Mind","year":" 1968","remarks":["(TV Series)","(writer)"],"imdbid":"tt0062549"},{"title":"Marty","year":" 1968","remarks":["(TV Series)","(writer)"],"imdbid":"tt0129696"},{"title":"Do Not Adjust Your Set","year":" 1968","remarks":["(TV Series)","(additional material - 4 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt0061247"}]},{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Absolutely Anything","year":" 2015","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1727770"},{"title":"Jupiter Ascending","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1617661"},{"title":"Monty Python Live (Mostly)","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3872778"},{"title":"9 mois ferme","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2853614"},{"title":"I rec u","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2773034"},{"title":"The Unfinished Swan","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Video Game)"],"imdbid":"tt2461590"},{"title":"A Liar's Autobiography: The Untrue Story of Monty Python's Graham Chapman","year":" 2012","remarks":["Interview Don #2 / Dr One Across / Pilot / ...
