Beginning with Outbreak (1995) about the outbreak of a killer virus. This film had shades of an Irwin Allen disaster movie, The Swarm (1978), about the outbreak of killer bees. Both films had the military and scientists clash, also both had choppers all over the place. Then came Air Force One (1997), about terrorists taking over the presidents plane. This film had shades of a 1970s Airport disaster film. The Perfect Storm (2000) came next, and while the script about a boat at sea in a storm was okay, the constant fake looking computer generated sea water damaged the film. And then came Poseidon (2006), about a passenger ship turning over at sea. Outbreak just hinted at being an Irwin Allen remake, but with Poseidon it was now official..this was a remake of Allen's The Poseidon Adventure (1972). The new Poseidon movie was Petersen's worst action/disaster movie by a long way. From casting to scripting the movie was terrible and our director made the same mistake seen in The Perfect Storm by having fake CGI sea water all over the place. In fact, the 1972 original had better effects and the 1972 Poseidon turn-over scene was filmed using a model in a tank. But Petersen deserves a place in history for his two wonderful movies, Outbreak and Air Force One.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNTQ5ODY4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDcyMDI1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000583","name":"Wolfgang Petersen","nicknames":["Wolfie"],"idIMDB":"nm0000583","filmographies":[{"section":"Director","filmography":[{"title":"Vier gegen die Bank","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5173166"},{"title":"Poseidon","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0409182"},{"title":"Troy","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0332452"},{"title":"The Perfect Storm","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0177971"},{"title":"Air Force One","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0118571"},{"title":"Outbreak","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0114069"},{"title":"In the Line of Fire","year":" 1993","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0107206"},{"title":"Shattered","year":" 1991","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0102900"},{"title":"Le bateau","year":" 1985-1987","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)","(6 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt0081834"},{"title":"Enemy Mine","year":" 1985","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0089092"},{"title":"The NeverEnding Story","year":" 1984","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0088323"},{"title":"Das Boot","year":" 1981","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0082096"},{"title":"L'Échiquier de la Passion","year":" 1978","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0078211"},{"title":"Planübung","year":" 1977","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0076548"},{"title":"La conséquence","year":" 1977","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0076280"},{"title":"Tatort","year":" 1971-1977","remarks":["(TV Series)","(6 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt0806910"},{"title":"Vier gegen die Bank","year":" 1976","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0075392"},{"title":"Hans im Glück","year":" 1976","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0074604"},{"title":"Stellenweise Glatteis","year":" 1975","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0073746"},{"title":"Die Stadt im Tal","year":" 1975","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)","(2 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt0072565"},{"title":"Aufs Kreuz gelegt","year":" 1974","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0071173"},{"title":"One or the Other","year":" 1974","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0071459"},{"title":"Pas de frontières pour l'inspecteur: Discrétion absolue","year":" 1973","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0070867"},{"title":"Smog","year":" 1973","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0070708"},{"title":"Anna und Totò","year":" 1972","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0068214"},{"title":"I Will Kill You, Wolf","year":" 1971","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0067234"},{"title":"Der Eine -
