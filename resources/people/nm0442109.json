He moved from Massapequa, New York to West Hartford, Connecticut in 1972 where he attended high school. As a comedic actor, he performed in school plays and, after graduation, he enrolled at Boston University but soon transferred NYU to study film. Charlie worked in the circulation department of the Star Tribune, in Minneapolis, in the late 1980s and moved to Los Angeles in 1991, where he was hired to write for the TV sitcom Get a Life (1990). He went on to write comedy sketches and a variety of TV show episodes. Between writing assignments, he wrote the inventive screenplay Being John Malkovich (1999), which created Hollywood interest and the attention of producer Steve Golin. Charlie works at home in Pasadena, California, where he lives with his wife Denise and children.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5NzUyNjYxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDM1NDg0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0442109","name":"Charlie Kaufman","idIMDB":"nm0442109","filmographies":[{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"Chaos Walking","year":" 2018","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt2076822"},{"title":"Anomalisa","year":" 2015","remarks":["(play -
