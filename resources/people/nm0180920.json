While still a teenager, she made her film debut in Naughty Arlette (1949). One of her most memorable film performances was in Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange (1971) as the victim of the bizarre gang-rape by Alex and his Droogs. In addition to film, she also frequently worked in television and continued in theater, specializing in fiery, flamboyant characters throughout her career.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5MDc0MjkxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg3MDgwOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0180920","name":"Adrienne Corri","idIMDB":"nm0180920","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Lovejoy","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0090477"},{"title":"Sunday Premiere","year":" 1987","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0272411"},{"title":"Shades of Darkness","year":" 1986","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1729107"},{"title":"Dramarama","year":" 1985","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0086699"},{"title":"Love in a Cold Climate","year":" 1980","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0180369"},{"title":"Doctor Who","year":" 1980","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0056751"},{"title":"The Human Factor","year":" 1979","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0080903"},{"title":"Measure for Measure","year":" 1979","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0077920"},{"title":"BBC Play of the Month","year":" 1968-1978","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0165593"},{"title":"Revenge of the Pink Panther","year":" 1978","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0078163"},{"title":"Rosebud","year":" 1975","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0073637"},{"title":"Madhouse","year":" 1974","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0071790"},{"title":"Bedtime Stories","year":" 1974","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0419311"},{"title":"Napoleon and Love","year":" 1974","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0071020"},{"title":"The Fox","year":" 1973","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt1740550"},{"title":"Vienna 1900","year":" 1973","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0080302"},{"title":"ITV Sunday Night Theatre","year":" 1970-1973","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0297621"},{"title":"The Adventurer","year":" 1973","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0068029"},{"title":"The View from Daniel Pike","year":" 1972","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0405609"},{"title":"Vampire Circus","year":" 1972","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0067924"},{"title":"A Clockwork Orange","year":" 1971","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0066921"},{"title":"A Family at War","year":" 1971","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0159164"},{"title":"Eyeless in Gaza","year":" 1971","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0346956"},{"title":"You're Only Young Twice","year":" 1971","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0066727"},{"title":"UFO","year":" 1970","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0063962"},{"title":"Play for Today","year":" 1970","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0165592"},{"title":"Moon Zero Two","year":" 1969","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0064691"},{"title":"Department S","year":" 1969","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0063893"},{"title":"My Partner the Ghost","year":" 1969","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0063946"},{"title":"ITV Playhouse","year":" 1969","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0298665"},{"title":"The File of the Golden Goose","year":" 1969","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0064328"},{"title":"The Champions","year":" 1969","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0062551"},{"title":"Cry Wolf","year":" 1969","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0202842"},{"title":"Journey Into Darkness","year":" 1968","remarks":["Terry Lawrence (segment \"The New People\")"],"imdbid":"tt0230378"},{"title":"Journey to the Unknown","year":" 1968","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0062574"},{"title":"Gazette","year":" 1968","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0159166"},{"title":"Sept fois femme","year":" 1967","remarks":["Mme.
