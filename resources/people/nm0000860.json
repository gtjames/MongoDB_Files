{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"6 August 1938","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York, USA","bio":"Paul Bartel was born in Brooklyn in 1938. He decided he wanted to direct animated movies when he was 11 and by 13 had spent a summer working at New York's UPA animation studio. He majored in theater arts at UCLA, and received a Fulbright scholarship to study film direction in Rome, producing a short that was presented at the 1962 Venice Fiom Festival. He later was hired by Roger Corman's brother, Gene, to direct a low-budget horror featured called \"Private Parts,\" released in 1972. Roger Corman hired him as a second unit director on \"Big Bad Mama,\" which led to his directing \"Death Race 2000\" in 1978. He could not persuade Corman to finance his pet project, \"Eating Raoul.\" The $500,000 black comedy was made after his parents sold their New Jersey home and gave him the money. Shot in 22 days, mostly weekends, over the course of a year, \"Eating Raoul\" starred Bartel and Mary Woronov as gourmet cannibals who lure sex swingers to their apartment, smack them with a skillet, rob them and use the proceeds to buy a restaurant.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NDg5MzQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTcwMTg5Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000860","name":"Paul Bartel","idIMDB":"nm0000860","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Perfect Fit","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0198903"},{"title":"Dinner and a Movie","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0215719"},{"title":"Hamlet","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0171359"},{"title":"Snoops","year":" 2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0202752"},{"title":"Zoo","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0187614"},{"title":"Good vs Evil","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0195462"},{"title":"Ally McBeal","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0118254"},{"title":"Hard Time: The Premonition","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0169990"},{"title":"Vengeance Unlimited","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0158421"},{"title":"Dreamers","year":" 1999/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0160229"},{"title":"Race","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0127020"},{"title":"Armistead Maupin's More Tales of the City","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0120574"},{"title":"Chicago Hope","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0108724"},{"title":"Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0137386"},{"title":"The Devil's Child","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0123036"},{"title":"The Inheritance","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0119369"},{"title":"Boston Common","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115115"},{"title":"Skeletons","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0117661"},{"title":"Lewis & Clark & George","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0113646"},{"title":"The Elevator","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0116182"},{"title":"Cybill","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0111932"},{"title":"Prey of the Jaguar","year":" 1996","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt0117380"},{"title":"Clueless","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115137"},{"title":"Basquiat","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0115632"},{"title":"Escape from L.A.","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0116225"},{"title":"Joe's Apartment","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0116707"},{"title":"Red Ribbon Blues","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0114246"},{"title":"Number One Fan","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0114016"},{"title":"Love and Happiness","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0113709"},{"title":"A Bucket of Blood","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0112594"},{"title":"Not Like Us","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0114003"},{"title":"Naomi & Wynonna: Love Can Build a Bridge","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0113931"},{"title":"The Wacky Adventures of Dr. Boris and Nurse Shirley","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0114882"},{"title":"The Jerky Boys","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0110189"},{"title":"The Usual Suspects","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0114814"},{"title":"Twin Sitters","year":" 1994","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0122768"},{"title":"Shelf Life","year":" 1993","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0108111"},{"title":"Grief","year":" 1993","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0107045"},{"title":"Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106148"},{"title":"Acting on Impulse","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0106216"},{"title":"The Comic Strip Presents...","year":" 1992-1993","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0083402"},{"title":"Posse","year":" 1993","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0107863"},{"title":"Soulmates","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0105446"},{"title":"The Living End","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0104745"},{"title":"The Pope Must Diet","year":" 1991","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0102691"},{"title":"Liquid Dreams","year":" 1991","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0104735"},{"title":"L.A.
