His family moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky, where his father, a professor, was head of the music department at Western Kentucky University. He attended Western Kentucky University and then USC film school in Los Angeles. He began making short films in 1962, and won an Academy Award for Best Live-Action Short Subject in 1970, for The Resurrection of Broncho Billy (1970), which he made while at USC. Carpenter formed a band in the mid-1970s called The Coupe de Villes, which included future directors Tommy Lee Wallace and Nick Castle. Since the 1970s, he has had numerous roles in the film industry including writer, actor, composer, producer, and director. After directing Dark Star (1974), he has helmed both classic horror films like Halloween (1978), The Fog (1980), and The Thing (1982), and noted sci-fi tales like Escape from New York (1981) and Starman (1984).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAzMzgwNDgzODBeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA2OTk2NDEx._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000118","name":"John Carpenter","nicknames":["JC"],"idIMDB":"nm0000118","filmographies":[{"section":"Soundtrack","filmography":[{"title":"The X Factor","year":" ","remarks":["(TV Series)","(performer - 1 episode, 2016)","(writer - 1 episode, 2016)"],"imdbid":"tt0423776"},{"title":"John Carpenter: Utopian Facade","year":" 2016","remarks":["(Video short)","(performer: \"Utopian Facade\")","/ (writer: \"Utopian Facade\")"],"imdbid":"tt6404974"},{"title":"John Carpenter: Distant Dream","year":" 2016","remarks":["(Video short)","(performer: \"Distant Dream\")","/ (writer: \"Distant Dream\")"],"imdbid":"tt5644778"},{"title":"Limitless","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)","(performer - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt4422836"},{"title":"The Simpsons","year":" 2013-2015","remarks":["(TV Series)","(writer - 2 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt0096697"},{"title":"HALLOWEEN: The Rebirth of Michael Myers","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Short)","(performer: \"The Shape\")","/ (writer: \"The Shape\")"],"imdbid":"tt5057898"},{"title":"Jason Voorhees vs. Michael Myers","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Short)","(writer: \"Michael Myers Theme Song\")"],"imdbid":"tt4819770"},{"title":"Love","year":" 2015/II","remarks":["(performer: \"Night\")","/ (writer: \"Main Title\", \"Night\")"],"imdbid":"tt3774694"},{"title":"John Carpenter: Night","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Video short)","(writer: \"Night\")"],"imdbid":"tt5644786"},{"title":"Halloween on Dartmoor","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Video short)","(writer: \"Halloween Theme\", \"Happy Halloween - Silver shamrock\")"],"imdbid":"tt5724510"},{"title":"Punk 'n' Spice","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Short)","(performer: \"Halloween\" theme song)","/ (writer: \"Halloween\" theme song)"],"imdbid":"tt4130580"},{"title":"The Babysitter","year":" 2014/I","remarks":["(Short)","(performer: \"The Shape\")","/ (writer: \"The Shape\")"],"imdbid":"tt4177506"},{"title":"Daily Ukulele","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Series short)","(writer - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt3912680"},{"title":"The Comix Scrutinizer","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Series)","(1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt2637554"},{"title":"Yu-Gi-Oh!
