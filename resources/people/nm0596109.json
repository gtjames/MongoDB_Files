Following important stage roles in \"Long Day's Journey Into Night\" and \"Julius Caesar\" in 1957, he made his West End bow with \"A Passage to India\" in 1960. He subsequently made an auspicious film debut in the classic film Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and continued with work on the BBC as well in a couple of other series. Other epic films followed with supporting roles in Behold a Pale Horse (1964) and Khartoum (1966). He returned to Pakistan at the request of the Bhutto regime in the late 60s and set up the PIA Arts and Dance Academy, which received critical merit for its classical as well as folk dances and music. Highly critical of the political regime, he returned to England within a few years and resumed his career there, appearing in the highly touted miniseries \"The Jewel in the Crown\" (1984), among others. He has since traveled the world promoting his Urdu poetry and prose recitations to international acclaim.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0596109","name":"Zia Mohyeddin","idIMDB":"nm0596109","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Last Remarks","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Short)","The Radio Announcer (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2086867"},{"title":"Doomsday Gun","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0109650"},{"title":"Casualty","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096555"},{"title":"Gummed Labels","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Movie)","Zia (Dejected Detective)"],"imdbid":"tt0167970"},{"title":"Immaculate Conception","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0104489"},{"title":"Family Pride","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0926930"},{"title":"Chancer","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098766"},{"title":"Saracen","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0133315"},{"title":"Shalom Salaam","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0416422"},{"title":"Tickle on the Tum","year":" 1988","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0313137"},{"title":"Partition","year":" 1987","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0093704"},{"title":"We Are the Children","year":" 1987","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0094301"},{"title":"King of the Ghetto","year":" 1986","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0316994"},{"title":"Masterpiece Theatre: Lord Mountbatten -
