Pileggi","bio":"Nicholas Pileggi was born and raised in New York, the son of a shoe store owner. He worked as a journalist for Associated Press in the 1950s where he specialized in crime reporting. Over the next 30 years he built up his contacts and reputation, covering stories for New York magazine and contributing to many others, as he became an expert on crime, most especially the organized crime world of the Mafia. In 1986 he wrote \"Wiseguy\" which he subsequently developed into the Academy Award-winning screenplay for Goodfellas (1990) with Martin Scorsese. He followed that up with scripts for Casino (1995) (also with Scorsese) and City Hall (1996) as well as writing and producing several other crime-based movies and TV shows.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0683380","name":"Nicholas Pileggi","idIMDB":"nm0683380","filmographies":[{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"Scarpa","year":" ","remarks":["(written by)"],"imdbid":"tt3854566"},{"title":"The Brothers","year":" ","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt2328684"},{"title":"Untitled Nicholas Pileggi Project","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4012634"},{"title":"Vegas","year":" ","remarks":["(TV Series)","(creator -
