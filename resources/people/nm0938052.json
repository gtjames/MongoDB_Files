After a long apprenticeship in the theatre, the 38-year-old Wolfe finally debuted in films in The Barretts of Wimpole Street (1934), recreating his Broadway role. He then toiled away steadily in Hollywood for the next several decades, working as a supporting player in literally hundreds of film and TV productions well into his 90s. Though capable of a wide range of parts, Wolfe's gentle, patrician manner found him most often cast as a butler, a minister or a kindly doctor. He finally gained his greatest fame at the age of 85, effortlessly stealing scenes as Mama Carlson's doddering yet feisty butler \"Hirsch\" in several episodes of the MTM sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati (1978).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzcwNjA4NTk1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjkyNjAyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0938052","name":"Ian
