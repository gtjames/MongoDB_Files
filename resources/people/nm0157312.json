Fernando was given his \"Western\" name when he immigrated to Canada. Fernando's passion for acting began in Canada, performing on stage in musical theater productions in college which lead to various roles in TV and Film. In 2002 he moved to Los Angeles to pursue the film business full-time and is where he resides today. Bouncing between stunt and acting roles for 11 years in Los Angeles he honed his skills through his action team Reel Kick, whose members are currently some of Hollywood's most sought after action artists and stunt performers. While simultaneously studying acting at some of LA's best schools such as Michael Beach's Actors Gym, Groundlings, Howard Fine Acting Studio and Lee Strasberg Studio. Starting Tae Kwon Do and Karate at the age of 6, Fernando never really took martial arts seriously until his 20's where he studied Hung-Gar Kung Fu in Montreal, Quebec. After moving to Los Angeles he was introduced to Wushu and eventually Jiu-Jitsu and Muay Thai. Favoring the contact sports more than the performance martial arts he studied under Gokor Chivichyan and Sensei Gene LeBell at the Hayastan MMA Academy and currently at the Werdum Combat Team under Master Fabricio Werdum (Brazilian Jiu Jitsu) and Andrew Hagar (Dutch Style Kickboxing).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTI2NTg0MDA3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDkwMjY2NTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0157312","name":"Fernando Chien","idIMDB":"nm0157312","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Sun Dogs","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5665452"},{"title":"Unspoken: Diary of an Assassin","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3572642"},{"title":"Perceptions","year":" 2016/II","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt6011402"},{"title":"The Concessionaires Must Die!","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3257092"},{"title":"The Accountant","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2140479"},{"title":"The Last Ship","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2402207"},{"title":"Dirty Lies","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3449322"},{"title":"A Need for Blood","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt4312970"},{"title":"Therapy Required","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt3581544"},{"title":"We Are Fathers","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3381742"},{"title":"Croisades","year":" 2014/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1552224"},{"title":"Transcendence","year":" 2014/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2209764"},{"title":"Ray Donovan","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2249007"},{"title":"Iron Man 3","year":" 2013","remarks":["Extremis Soldier (as Funan Chien)"],"imdbid":"tt1300854"},{"title":"Cinnamon Girl","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt2194794"},{"title":"Red Dawn","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1234719"},{"title":"The Division","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1949980"},{"title":"The Indestructible Jimmy Brown","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt2153981"},{"title":"Warrior","year":" 2011","remarks":["(as Fernando Funan Chien)"],"imdbid":"tt1291584"},{"title":"True Justice","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1697033"},{"title":"Fast Five","year":" 2011","remarks":["(as Fernando F.
