A graduate of Rutgers University, he earned a Master of Fine Arts degree from Temple University in his hometown. After spending some time in regional theater, he headed west to Los Angeles to break into films and television. He spent a good deal of time on stage in L.A., and quickly began racking up television and movie credits. He was a regular on the detective series Hunter (1984) - as, what else, a cop - and turned in a standout performance as a corrupt, racist detective in a story arc on Hill Street Blues (1981). He also appeared in such films as Silkwood (1983), Kidco (1984), Executive Decision (1996) and Dante's Peak (1997). He died of a heart attack in Los Angeles in 1997.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwNjA2NTcyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk2OTI0MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0356251","name":"Charles Hallahan","nicknames":["Chuck"],"idIMDB":"nm0356251","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Mind Rage","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0251272"},{"title":"Ambushed","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0138289"},{"title":"Players","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0118431"},{"title":"The Visitor","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0118509"},{"title":"Things That Go Bump","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0117892"},{"title":"NYPD Blue","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106079"},{"title":"Dante's Peak","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0118928"},{"title":"John Leguizamo: The Pest","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0119887"},{"title":"Space Jam","year":" 1996","remarks":["Baron's Owner (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0117705"},{"title":"Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115184"},{"title":"Rolling Thunder","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0114292"},{"title":"The Rich Man's Wife","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0117473"},{"title":"The Fan","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0116277"},{"title":"Gargoyles","year":" 1995-1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0108783"},{"title":"Almost Perfect","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0111877"},{"title":"Sisters","year":" 1995-1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0101199"},{"title":"Executive Decision","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0116253"},{"title":"Coach","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096560"},{"title":"JAG","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0112022"},{"title":"Sweet Justice","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0108948"},{"title":"The Return of Hunter: Everyone Walks in L.A.","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0114273"},{"title":"Murder, She Wrote","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0086765"},{"title":"Mad About You","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0103484"},{"title":"Jack Reed: A Search for Justice","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0110174"},{"title":"Grace Under Fire","year":" 1993-1994","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106017"},{"title":"Roswell","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0111021"},{"title":"Jack's Place","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0103449"},{"title":"When Love Kills: The Seduction of John Hearn","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0106170"},{"title":"Wild Palms","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106175"},{"title":"Law & Order","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098844"},{"title":"Dave","year":" 1993","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0106673"},{"title":"Warlock: The Armageddon","year":" 1993","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0108517"},{"title":"Les anges de la ville","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106133"},{"title":"In the Heat of the Night","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0094484"},{"title":"Body","year":" 1993","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0106453"},{"title":"Picket Fences","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0103512"},{"title":"Civil Wars","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0101064"},{"title":"Nails","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0104966"},{"title":"A Smile in the Dark","year":" 1991","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0163256"},{"title":"Cast a Deadly Spell","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0101550"},{"title":"Hunter","year":" 1986-1991","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0086734"},{"title":"Wings","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098948"},{"title":"ABC Afterschool Specials","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0202179"},{"title":"The Revenge of Al Capone","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0098198"},{"title":"True Believer","year":" 1989","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0098524"},{"title":"The Law and Harry McGraw","year":" 1988","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0092392"},{"title":"Fatal Beauty","year":" 1987","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0093011"},{"title":"J.
