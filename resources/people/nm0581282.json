He began his career acting in summer stock plays. He married Barbara Leeds, an actress, and then served a brief stint in the army. After the army, he landed in New York, where he was chosen to join the already popular play \"Born Yesterday\". In 1950 he was cast in the part of Bill Sampson in All About Eve (1950). It would be his first time meeting Bette Davis and they became an instant couple. After their respective divorces, they were married in Mexico. She was 42 and he was 35. During their marriage they adopted two children, Margot and Michael, and after ten years of fighting and financial problems they divorced. Merrill did not marry again, though he was involved with Rita Hayworth for a time. Later in his career Merrill made a lucrative living doing voice-overs for radio and television commercials. In 1988 he published his autobiography, \"Bette, Rita, And The Rest Of My Life\". He died of lung cancer at the age of 74.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMDI5NzgzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTI3MjI2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0581282","name":"Gary
