{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"19 November 1983","placeOfBirth":" San Diego, California, USA","birthName":"Adam Douglas Driver","height":"6' 2½\" (1.89 m)","bio":"Adam Douglas Driver was born in San Diego, California. His mother, Nancy (Needham) Wright, is a paralegal from Mishawaka, Indiana, and his father, Joe Douglas Driver, who has deep roots in the American South, is from Little Rock, Arkansas. His stepfather is a Baptist minister. His ancestry includes English, as well as Dutch, German, Irish, and Scottish. Driver was raised in Mishawaka after his parents' divorce, attending Mishawaka High School, where he appeared in plays. After 9/11, he enlisted in the Marines, serving for more than two years before being medically discharged after he suffered an injury, which prevented him from being deployed. Driver attended the University of Indianapolis (for a year) and then transferred to study drama at Juilliard in New York, graduating in 2009. He began acting in plays, appearing on Broadway, before being cast in Lena Dunham's series Girls (2012), as her character's love interest, Adam Sackler. The role gained him attention, and he subsequently began a robust film career, appearing in small roles in J. Edgar (2011) and Lincoln (2012), supporting roles in Frances Ha (2012) and Inside Llewyn Davis (2013), and graduating to major parts in the comedy-drama This Is Where I Leave You (2014) and the upcoming Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) and Martin Scorsese's Silence (2016), the latter film opposite Andrew Garfield.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0OTA0NjU0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUzNjk3Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3485845","name":"Adam Driver","idIMDB":"nm3485845","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Annette","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6217926"},{"title":"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1318517"},{"title":"Tough as They Come","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6389432"},{"title":"Star Wars: Episode VIII","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2527336"},{"title":"Logan Lucky","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5439796"},{"title":"Girls","year":" 2012-2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1723816"},{"title":"Silence","year":" 2016/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0490215"},{"title":"Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens","year":" 2016","remarks":["(Video Game)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt5430544"},{"title":"Paterson","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5247022"},{"title":"Midnight Special","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2649554"},{"title":"Star Wars: The Force Awakens","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2488496"},{"title":"The Simpsons","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096697"},{"title":"Disney Infinity 3.0","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Video Game)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt4671444"},{"title":"This Is Where I Leave You","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1371150"},{"title":"While We're Young","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1791682"},{"title":"Hungry Hearts","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3344922"},{"title":"What If","year":" 2013/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1486834"},{"title":"Tracks","year":" 2013/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2167266"},{"title":"Inside Llewyn Davis","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2042568"},{"title":"Bluebird","year":" 2013/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1567279"},{"title":"The River","year":" 2013/I","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt2369914"},{"title":"Lincoln","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0443272"},{"title":"Frances Ha","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2347569"},{"title":"Not Waving But Drowning","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1859558"},{"title":"Gayby","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2106739"},{"title":"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0203259"},{"title":"I'm Coming Over","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1871293"},{"title":"J.
