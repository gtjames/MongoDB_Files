{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"21 March 1891","placeOfBirth":" Hamilton, Ontario, Canada","birthName":"Jonathan Hatley","bio":"Canadian-born Jonathan Hale had a long film career, appearing in over 200 pictures. He was a member of the diplomatic service prior to his film career, and his stately bearing stood him in good stead for the variety of corporate executives, military officers and high-level politicians he often played. His best known and most memorable part was that of Dagwood Bumstead's boss J.C. Dithers in the \"Blondie\" series, a role he assayed from the first entry (Blondie (1938)) until he left the series in 1946. In 1966, despondent over personal problems, he shot himself to death.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA0MTc4MjMtOTkxZi00NTE3LTg5N2ItMzFmMGZlMDhjMzliXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0354947","name":"Jonathan Hale","idIMDB":"nm0354947","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Kraft Suspense Theatre","year":" 1965","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0056768"},{"title":"The Joey Bishop Show","year":" 1962","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0054552"},{"title":"Full Speed for Anywhere","year":" 1960","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0440404"},{"title":"The Three Outlaws","year":" 1956","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0049848"},{"title":"Crossroads","year":" 1955-1956","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047724"},{"title":"Our Miss Brooks","year":" 1956","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0044287"},{"title":"Jaguar","year":" 1956","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0049379"},{"title":"Brave Eagle","year":" 1956","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047716"},{"title":"Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color","year":" 1956","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0046593"},{"title":"Screen Directors Playhouse","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047768"},{"title":"Science Fiction Theatre","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047767"},{"title":"Schlitz Playhouse","year":" 1952-1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0043228"},{"title":"The Night Holds Terror","year":" 1955","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0048423"},{"title":"Cavalcade of America","year":" 1953-1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0044248"},{"title":"The Whistler","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0166467"},{"title":"Soldiers of Fortune","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047773"},{"title":"The Pepsi-Cola Playhouse","year":" 1954-1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0045430"},{"title":"The Star and the Story","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047738"},{"title":"City Detective","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0045378"},{"title":"TV Reader's Digest","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047780"},{"title":"Lassie","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0046617"},{"title":"The Loretta Young Show","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0045409"},{"title":"The Ford Television Theatre","year":" 1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0041024"},{"title":"Adventures of the Falcon","year":" 1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047704"},{"title":"Cattle Queen of Montana","year":" 1954","remarks":["(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0046839"},{"title":"Studio 57","year":" 1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0046648"},{"title":"Fireside Theatre","year":" 1953-1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0041023"},{"title":"Men of the Fighting Lady","year":" 1954","remarks":["Home Movie Commentator (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0047230"},{"title":"General Electric Theater","year":" 1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0045395"},{"title":"She Couldn't Say No","year":" 1954","remarks":["John Bentley (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0047476"},{"title":"Duffy of San Quentin","year":" 1954","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0046945"},{"title":"Mr. & Mrs. North","year":" 1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0044277"},{"title":"The Flaming Urge","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045772"},{"title":"Adventures of Superman","year":" 1953","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0044231"},{"title":"Cowboy G-Men","year":" 1952-1953","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0044254"},{"title":"Kansas Pacific","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045954"},{"title":"Taxi","year":" 1953","remarks":["Mr. Barker (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0046405"},{"title":"The Steel Trap","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045190"},{"title":"Son of Paleface","year":" 1952","remarks":["Gov.
