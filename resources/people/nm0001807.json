Her mother, Theodosia, was a domestic, and her father, William Tyson, was a carpenter and painter. She was discovered by a fashion editor at Ebony magazine and, with her stunning looks, she quickly rose to the top of the modeling industry. In 1957, she began acting in Off-Broadway productions. She had small roles in feature films before she was cast as Portia in The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (1968). Four years later, Cicely was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her sensational performance in the critically acclaimed film Sounder (1972). In 1974, she went on to portray a 110-year-old former slave in The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman (1974), which earned her two Emmy Awards. She also appeared in the television miniseries Roots (1977), King (1978) and A Woman Called Moses (1978). While Cicely has not appeared steadily onscreen because of her loyalty to only portray strong, positive images of Black women, she is without a doubt one of the most talented, beautiful actresses to have ever graced the stage and screen.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4OTM1MDczN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDI5NzcyMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001807","name":"Cicely Tyson","idIMDB":"nm0001807","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Showing Roots","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4163960"},{"title":"How to Get Away with Murder","year":" 2015-2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3205802"},{"title":"House of Cards","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1856010"},{"title":"The Trip to Bountiful","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt3317326"},{"title":"The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1457765"},{"title":"Alex Cross","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1712170"},{"title":"The Help","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1454029"},{"title":"Why Did I Get Married Too?","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1391137"},{"title":"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0203259"},{"title":"Relative Stranger","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt1252330"},{"title":"Idlewild","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0417225"},{"title":"Fat Rose and Squeaky","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0476992"},{"title":"Madea's Family Reunion","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0455612"},{"title":"Diary of a Mad Black Woman","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0422093"},{"title":"Higglytown Heroes","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0406419"},{"title":"Because of Winn-Dixie","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0317132"},{"title":"The Proud Family","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0293737"},{"title":"The Rosa Parks Story","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0293562"},{"title":"Un amour infini","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0245182"},{"title":"Au-delà du réel - l'aventure continue","year":" 2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0112111"},{"title":"Touched by an Angel","year":" 2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0108968"},{"title":"Aftershock: Earthquake in New York","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0186804"},{"title":"A Lesson Before Dying","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0179940"},{"title":"Always Outnumbered","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0146425"},{"title":"Mama Flora's Family","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0162462"},{"title":"Ms. Scrooge","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0130883"},{"title":"Hoodlum","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0119311"},{"title":"The Price of Heaven","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0123228"},{"title":"Riot","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Movie)","Maggie (segment \"Homecoming Day\")"],"imdbid":"tt0120021"},{"title":"Bridge of Time","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0118776"},{"title":"The Road to Galveston","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0117492"},{"title":"Sweet Justice","year":" 1994-1995","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0108948"},{"title":"Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0110721"},{"title":"House of Secrets","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0107150"},{"title":"When No One Would Listen","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0105806"},{"title":"Duplicates","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0104154"},{"title":"Fried Green Tomatoes","year":" 1991","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0101921"},{"title":"Clippers","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0367611"},{"title":"The Kid Who Loved Christmas","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0099930"},{"title":"Heat Wave","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0099751"},{"title":"B.L.
