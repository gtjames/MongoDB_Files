Additionally, he served as the National Black Arts Festival's (NBAF) Artistic Director throughout the 1990s in Atlanta, Georgia. An actor, activist, musician, director, and educator of epic proportions, Brooks was quoted in an interview about his work with NBAF and his performances: \"If I were a carpenter, I'd find a way to empower using that skill. I'm using as much as God has given--my mind, my voice, my heart, my art forms. This is the highest form of expression on the planet from God, to me, to you\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3ODIyNDI3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjQ3MTcz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000984","name":"Avery Brooks","idIMDB":"nm0000984","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Star Trek: Legacy","year":" 2006","remarks":["(Video Game)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0844485"},{"title":"Bible Mysteries","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1366307"},{"title":"15 Minutes","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0179626"},{"title":"God Lives Underwater: Fame","year":" 2001","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt3770694"},{"title":"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine","year":" 1993-1999","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106145"},{"title":"American History X","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0120586"},{"title":"The Big Hit","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0120609"},{"title":"Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0111996"},{"title":"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - Harbinger","year":" 1996","remarks":["(Video Game)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0413308"},{"title":"Gargoyles","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0108783"},{"title":"Spenser: A Savage Place","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0114509"},{"title":"Spenser: The Judas Goat","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0111259"},{"title":"Spenser: Pale Kings and Princes","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0111258"},{"title":"Spenser: Ceremony","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0108202"},{"title":"The Ernest Green Story","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0106826"},{"title":"A Man Called Hawk","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096646"},{"title":"Roots: The Gift","year":" 1988","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0096009"},{"title":"Spenser: For Hire","year":" 1985-1988","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0088612"},{"title":"Moments Without Proper Names","year":" 1987","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0270518"},{"title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin","year":" 1987","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0094213"},{"title":"Finnegan Begin Again","year":" 1985","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0089145"},{"title":"American Playhouse","year":" 1984","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0176357"}]},{"section":"Director","filmography":[{"title":"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine","year":" 1994-1999","remarks":["(TV Series)","(9 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt0106145"}]},{"section":"Music department","filmography":[{"title":"The Captains","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Documentary)","(music supervisor)"],"imdbid":"tt1946421"},{"title":"A Man Called Hawk","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Series)","(composer - 5 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt0096646"}]},{"section":"Soundtrack","filmography":[{"title":"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine","year":" 1998-1999","remarks":["(TV Series)","(performer - 2 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt0106145"}]},{"section":"Thanks","filmography":[{"title":"The Captains","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Documentary)","(very special thanks)"],"imdbid":"tt1946421"},{"title":"Star Trek: Beyond the Final Frontier","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)","(special thanks)"],"imdbid":"tt0970511"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"The Captains Close Up","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2862034"},{"title":"Captain's Table","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt2374887"},{"title":"The Captains","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt1946421"},{"title":"For Love of Liberty: The Story of America's Black Patriots","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0800037"},{"title":"Drain the Ocean","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)","Narrator (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1485703"},{"title":"God v.
