She attended Connetquot Senior High School and graduated in the class of 1986. Later Moira attended Marymount Manhattan College. In 1984 Moira was cast in a small role in Connetquot Senior High School's production of Annie. Due to illness, the young woman playing Miss Hannigan was replaced, causing a series of cast changes. Director Eric Martinsen chose to recast Moira as Grace Farrell. She was a great success, and so began her career.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDIyNjQwNDg4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzEyMDg4Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0446702","name":"Moira Kelly","idIMDB":"nm0446702","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Twin Peaks: The Missing Pieces","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5334704"},{"title":"Drop Dead Diva","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1280822"},{"title":"12 ans sans ma fille","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt2275977"},{"title":"A Smile as Big as the Moon","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt2100380"},{"title":"Numb3rs","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0433309"},{"title":"One Tree Hill","year":" 2003-2009","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0368530"},{"title":"Heroes","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0813715"},{"title":"Law & Order","year":" 1991-2008","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098844"},{"title":"Remember the Daze","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0790618"},{"title":"Two Tickets to Paradise","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0463963"},{"title":"The Lion King 1 1/2","year":" 2004","remarks":["(Video)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0318403"},{"title":"A Woman Reported","year":" 2004","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0392918"},{"title":"La treizième dimension","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0318252"},{"title":"Hack","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0320022"},{"title":"The Safety of Objects","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0256359"},{"title":"The West Wing","year":" 1999-2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0200276"},{"title":"Henry Hill","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0131421"},{"title":"The Lion King II: Simba's Pride Active Play","year":" 1998","remarks":["(Video Game)"],"imdbid":"tt0215933"},{"title":"To Have & to Hold","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0144071"},{"title":"Monday After the Miracle","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0170256"},{"title":"The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride","year":" 1998","remarks":["(Video)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0120131"},{"title":"Hi-Life","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0132213"},{"title":"Dangerous Beauty","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0118892"},{"title":"Drive, She Said","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0119021"},{"title":"Changing Habits","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0115865"},{"title":"La part du mal","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0118727"},{"title":"Entertaining Angels: The Dorothy Day Story","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0116212"},{"title":"Décroche les étoiles","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0118044"},{"title":"The Tie That Binds","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0114666"},{"title":"Animated StoryBook: The Lion King","year":" 1994","remarks":["(Video Game)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1332665"},{"title":"Little Odessa","year":" 1994","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0110365"},{"title":"The Lion King","year":" 1994","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0110357"},{"title":"With Honors","year":" 1994","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0111732"},{"title":"Daybreak","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0106676"},{"title":"Chaplin","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0103939"},{"title":"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0105665"},{"title":"The Cutting Edge","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0104040"},{"title":"Thirty Below Zero","year":" 1992","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0403599"},{"title":"Billy Bathgate","year":" 1991","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0101453"},{"title":"The Boy Who Cried Bitch","year":" 1991","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0101504"},{"title":"Love, Lies and Murder","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0101136"}]},{"section":"Director","filmography":[{"title":"One Tree Hill","year":" 2006-2007","remarks":["(TV Series)","(2 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt0368530"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Made in Hollywood","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0911896"},{"title":"Made in Hollywood: Teen Edition","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1245693"},{"title":"Late Night with Conan O'Brien","year":" 1994-1995","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106052"},{"title":"The Making of 'The Lion King'","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0366742"}]},{"section":"Archive footage","filmography":[{"title":"One Tree Hill","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0368530"},{"title":"President Hollywood","year":" 2008","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)","(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt1297342"},{"title":"Entertainment Tonight","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0081857"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/15 04:04:29"}}
