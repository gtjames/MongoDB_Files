Byrne A graduate of Boston College with a double major in finance and theatre and an M.F.A. in Acting from the prestigious Theatre School at DePaul University, actor P.J. Byrne has compiled a long list of impressive film and television credits. In 2014, Byrne starred alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in The Wolf of Wall Street for director Martin Scorsese and has teamed up again with the famed director and writer Terence Winter on Vinyl for HBO. His most recent films include True Memoirs of an International Assassin opposite Kevin James and The Gift opposite Jason Bateman and Joel Edgerton. Byrne is also adding writer to his resume having recently sold Brothers of the Bride to Newline, a feature film that he will co-write and star in which is being produced by Ben Stiller's Red Hour Productions. Renowned for his pivotal scene-stealing role in Horrible Bosses, Byrne's character supports the stars of the film as they plot to kill their bosses. This film allows him to add Kevin Spacey and Jason Bateman to a long list of important actors with whom he has had the opportunity to work. He has played opposite: Steve Carell in Dinner for Schmucks, Zach Galifianakis in The Campaign, Harrison Ford in Extraordinary Measures, Tom Hanks in Mike Nichols' Charlie Wilson's War, Will Ferrell and Nicole Kidman in Nora Ephron's Bewitched, Jack Black in Michel Gondry's Be Kind, Rewind, Jim Carrey in Bruce Almighty and Clint Eastwood in Bloodwork. Byrne was very well received for his starring role in the 5th installment of the phenomenally successful Final Destination franchise for Warner Bros. In the film Byrne's character meets one of the more unusual demises ever in the series of sci-fi horror films. Byrne's television credits include the fan favorite role of Irv Smiff, the driven sports agent, who represents a number of professional football players in the ongoing BET hit series The Game. He has appeared in recurring and guest roles on hit and acclaimed series such as NCIS, The Mentalist, Burn Notice, Bones and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Reno 911, West Wing, ER, Boston Legal, Desperate Housewives and New Adventures of Old Christine. In addition to his on-screen roles, Byrne also voices \"Bolin\" in the Emmy- nominated Nickelodeon series, The Legend of Korra now entering it's 4th season, and received a Behind The Voice Award for his portrayal of that character. A Garden State native, Byrne was born in Maplewood, New Jersey and was raised in Old Tappan, New Jersey.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyNjExNzQ3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDcwNDcxMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0126260","name":"P.J.
