She is a veteran of the American Conservatory Theater (A.C.T.), and also one of A.C.T.'s leading actresses in its first few seasons. After leaving A.C.T. in the early 1970s, Paton and her husband founded and ran the Berkeley Stage Company for a number of years. Since then, she and her husband, theatre director Robert Goldsby, moved to Malibu, CA, where they lived until 2015. Paton appeared in 38 films and over 50 TV series. She also continued her decades-long run of regional theatre work across the country, including her 2014 role in the Broadway play, Harvey.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTM0Nzc3ODA5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMxMjUxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0665708","name":"Angela Paton","idIMDB":"nm0665708","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Last Wishes","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt4001278"},{"title":"I Didn't Do It","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2996052"},{"title":"I Am I","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1825806"},{"title":"Grey's Anatomy","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0413573"},{"title":"Medium","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0412175"},{"title":"Sons of Tucson","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1361839"},{"title":"My Name Is Earl","year":" 2008","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0460091"},{"title":"The Final Season","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0449018"},{"title":"Lavinia's Heist","year":" 2007","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1064209"},{"title":"The Valley of Light","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0486506"},{"title":"Aisle 73","year":" 2006","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1291663"},{"title":"Four Kings","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0461721"},{"title":"Curb Your Enthusiasm","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0264235"},{"title":"Red Eye","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0421239"},{"title":"Numb3rs","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0433309"},{"title":"American Wedding","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0328828"},{"title":"JAG","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0112022"},{"title":"Die, Mommie, Die!","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0322023"},{"title":"The United States of Leland","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0301976"},{"title":"Becker","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0174378"},{"title":"First Monday","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0297560"},{"title":"The X-Files","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106179"},{"title":"That's Life","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0247136"},{"title":"Joe Dirt","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0245686"},{"title":"Early Bird Special","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0164555"},{"title":"The Kennedys","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0777236"},{"title":"Boston Public","year":" 2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0247081"},{"title":"The Joyriders","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0139394"},{"title":"Sliders","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0112167"},{"title":"L.A.
