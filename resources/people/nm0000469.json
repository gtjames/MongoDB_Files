At an early age, he started to take dramatic lessons to calm himself down. It appeared to work as he has since starred in many films over a 40-year period, beginning with the Stanley Kubrick classic Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964). He is probably best known for his role as Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy (for the voice only, as the man in the Darth Vader suit was David Prowse, whose voice was dubbed because of his British West Country accent). He has appeared on the animated series The Simpsons (1989) three times and played Mufasa in The Lion King (1994). James Earl Jones returned as the voice of Darth Vader in Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005) and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwNTg1MzMwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQyMDgyMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000469","name":"James Earl
