She is playing Arlene Moran, Sheriff Arnold Pope's (Terrence Howard) secretary in FX's Wayward Pines by Chad Hodge and Blake Crouch. The redheaded character actress has had many memorable roles in film and television. She was born in 1961 in Syracuse, New York, to Jane (Eagan) and William J. Fallon, an attorney, and is the second of five children. A graduate of Le Moyne College in Syracuse, she received her M.F.A. from Catholic University. She began her career on stage in her own character-driven, one-women shows. After appearing in her show, \"Bat Girl,\" she was cast on _\"Saturday Night Live\" in 1992. This show opened many doors for Fallon, and she then began to work steadily in film. Although she began in comedy, Fallon has a following in dramatic foreign films, notably Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark (2000) and Dogville (2003). She also played in Michael Haneke's Funny Games (2007). Her television credits include a recurring role on Seinfeld (1989) as Elaine's roommate, Alec Baldwin's sister on 30 Rock (2006) and several other guest spots. She has been happily married to commodities trader Peter Hogan for over twenty years. They have three children: Bernadette, Peter and Sinead.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzMTExMDgzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTI5MjQ2ODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0266441","name":"Siobhan Fallon
