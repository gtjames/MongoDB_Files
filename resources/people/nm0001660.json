{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"5 January 1914","placeOfBirth":" Woolstock, Iowa, USA","birthName":"George Keefer Brewer","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"George Reeves was born George Keefer Brewer in Woolstock, Iowa, to Helen Roberta (Lescher) and Donald C. Brewer. He was of German, English, and Scottish descent. Reeves was raised in Pasadena, California, and educated at Pasadena Junior College. He was a skilled amateur boxer and musician. He interned as an actor at the famed Pasadena Playhouse, and was discovered there. He was cast as Brent Tarleton in Gone with the Wind (1939). Over the next ten years he was contracted to Warners, Fox and Paramount. He achieved near-stardom as the male lead in So Proudly We Hail! (1943), but war service interrupted his career, and after he returned it never regained the same level. While in the Army Air Corps he appeared on Broadway in \"Winged Victory\", then made training films. Career difficulties after the war led him to move to New York for live television. It was television where he achieved the kind of fame that had eluded him in films, as he was cast in the lead of the now-iconic Adventures of Superman (1952). He got a few film roles, but he was mostly typecast as Superman, and other acting jobs soon dried up. His career had slid to the point where he was considering an attempt at exhibition wrestling when he committed suicide by shooting himself. Controversy still surrounds his death, due mainly to the fact of his longtime affair with Toni Lanier (aka Toni Mannix), the wife of MGM executive E.J. Mannix. Many of Reeves' friends and colleagues didn't believe that he had committed suicide but that his death was related to the Mannix situation. However, no credible evidence has ever been produced to support that contention.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2ODg0OTg3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTMzMTkyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001660","name":"George Reeves","idIMDB":"nm0001660","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Adventures of Superman","year":" 1952-1958","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0044231"},{"title":"I Love Lucy","year":" 1957","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0043208"},{"title":"Westward Ho, the Wagons!","year":" 1956","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0049945"},{"title":"Funny Boners","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0198121"},{"title":"Stamp Day for Superman","year":" 1954","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0046360"},{"title":"Forever Female","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045782"},{"title":"From Here to Eternity","year":" 1953","remarks":["Sergeant Maylon Stark (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0045793"},{"title":"The Blue Gardenia","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045564"},{"title":"The Ford Television Theatre","year":" 1952","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0041024"},{"title":"Kraft Theatre","year":" 1949-1952","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0039123"},{"title":"Fireside Theatre","year":" 1952","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0041023"},{"title":"Bugles in the Afternoon","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0044456"},{"title":"Rancho Notorious","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045070"},{"title":"Superman and the Mole-Men","year":" 1951","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0044091"},{"title":"Lights Out","year":" 1950-1951","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0041037"},{"title":"The Adventures of Ellery Queen","year":" 1950","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0042069"},{"title":"Hands of Mystery","year":" 1950","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0254897"},{"title":"Suspense","year":" 1949-1950","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0041061"},{"title":"The Web","year":" 1950","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0042167"},{"title":"Starlight Theatre","year":" 1950","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0203271"},{"title":"The Trap","year":" 1950","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0042158"},{"title":"The Good Humor Man","year":" 1950","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0042514"},{"title":"The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse","year":" 1950","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0040049"},{"title":"Believe It or Not","year":" 1950","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0041005"},{"title":"The Silver Theatre","year":" 1949-1950","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0041053"},{"title":"The Adventures of Sir Galahad","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041096"},{"title":"Samson and Delilah","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041838"},{"title":"Actor's Studio","year":" 1949","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0040021"},{"title":"The Great Lover","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041429"},{"title":"The Clock","year":" 1949","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0318215"},{"title":"Special Agent","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041910"},{"title":"The Mutineers","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041670"},{"title":"Jungle Jim","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040501"},{"title":"Thunder in the Pines","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040879"},{"title":"Jungle Goddess","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040500"},{"title":"The Sainted Sisters","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040754"},{"title":"Variety Girl","year":" 1947","remarks":["George Reeves (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0039951"},{"title":"Champagne for Two","year":" 1947","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0039258"},{"title":"Airborne Lifeboat","year":" 1945","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0037502"},{"title":"Time to Kill","year":" 1945","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0418240"},{"title":"Winged Victory","year":" 1944","remarks":["Lt.
