Charles Chaplin invited her to join him at Essanay Studio in 1915, the year of her film debut in Chaplin's His Night Out. Over the next seven years she appeared as his leading lady in over 20 Chaplin films made by Essanay, Mutual, and First National, including the classics The Tramp (1914), The Immigrant (1917), Easy Street (1917), The Kid (1921), and The Idle Class (1921). As a repayment for years of work with him, Chaplin intended real stardom for her with A Woman of Paris: A Drama of Fate (1923). The movie was a commercial failure though it advanced the career of Adolphe Menjou. She remained on Chaplin's payroll until her death, her last two appearances being non-speaking extra parts in his Monsieur Verdoux (1947) and Limelight (1952).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzMTI2MTcwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY4NjYxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0701012","name":"Edna Purviance","idIMDB":"nm0701012","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Limelight","year":" 1952","remarks":["Mrs. Parker (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0044837"},{"title":"Monsieur Verdoux","year":" 1947","remarks":["Garden Party Guest (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0039631"},{"title":"Éducation de prince","year":" 1927","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0199173"},{"title":"A Woman of the Sea","year":" 1926","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0017575"},{"title":"A Woman of Paris: A Drama of Fate","year":" 1923","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0014624"},{"title":"The Pilgrim","year":" 1923","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0014358"},{"title":"Pay Day","year":" 1922/I","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0013486"},{"title":"The Idle Class","year":" 1921","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0012304"},{"title":"The Kid","year":" 1921","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0012349"},{"title":"A Day's Pleasure","year":" 1919","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0010057"},{"title":"Sunnyside","year":" 1919","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0010747"},{"title":"Shoulder Arms","year":" 1918","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0009611"},{"title":"The Bond","year":" 1918","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0008907"},{"title":"Triple Trouble","year":" 1918","remarks":["(Short)","Maid (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0007476"},{"title":"A Dog's Life","year":" 1918","remarks":["(Short)","Bar Singer (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0009018"},{"title":"How to Make Movies","year":" 1918","remarks":["(Short)","Actress (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0430199"},{"title":"The Adventurer","year":" 1917/I","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0007613"},{"title":"The Immigrant","year":" 1917","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0008133"},{"title":"The Cure","year":" 1917","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0007832"},{"title":"Easy Street","year":" 1917","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0007880"},{"title":"The Rink","year":" 1916","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0007264"},{"title":"Behind the Screen","year":" 1916","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0006414"},{"title":"The Pawnshop","year":" 1916","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0007162"},{"title":"The Count","year":" 1916","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0006548"},{"title":"The Vagabond","year":" 1916","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0007507"},{"title":"The Fireman","year":" 1916","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0006684"},{"title":"The Floorwalker","year":" 1916","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0006689"},{"title":"Police","year":" 1916","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0007194"},{"title":"A Burlesque on Carmen","year":" 1915","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0005077"},{"title":"Burlesque on Carmen","year":" 1915","remarks":["(Short)","Carmen - the Gypsy (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0006497"},{"title":"A Night in the Show","year":" 1915","remarks":["(Short)","Lady in the Stalls with Beads (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0005812"},{"title":"Shanghaied","year":" 1915/I","remarks":["(Short)","Daughter of the Shipowner (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0006032"},{"title":"The Bank","year":" 1915","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0004936"},{"title":"A Woman","year":" 1915","remarks":["(Short)","Daughter of the House (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0006309"},{"title":"Work","year":" 1915","remarks":["(Short)","Maid (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0006313"},{"title":"By the Sea","year":" 1915","remarks":["(Short)","Wife of Man in Top Hat (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0005044"},{"title":"The Tramp","year":" 1915","remarks":["(Short)","Farmer's Daughter (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0006177"},{"title":"A Jitney Elopement","year":" 1915","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0005571"},{"title":"In the Park","year":" 1915","remarks":["(Short)","Nursemaid (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0005542"},{"title":"The Champion","year":" 1915","remarks":["(Short)","Trainer's Daughter (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0005074"},{"title":"A Night Out","year":" 1915/I","remarks":["(Short)","Headwaiter's Wife (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0005810"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Charlie's Life","year":" 1916","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0461168"}]},{"section":"Archive footage","filmography":[{"title":"La naissance de Charlot","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt4069220"},{"title":"Spisok korabley","year":" 2008","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt2034782"},{"title":"Why Be Good?
