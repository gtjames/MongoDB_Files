{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"28 June 1937","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York, USA","birthName":"Richard James Bright","height":"5' 7½\" (1.71 m)","bio":"Fair complexioned, cold-eyed actor Richard Bright has notched up an impressive array of character performances of often shifty, or deadly characters on the wrong side of the law. First came to attention as a burglar in the engrossing The Panic in Needle Park (1971), and then followed it the following year playing a slick con artist hustling naive Ali MacGraw for the bank robbery loot in The Getaway (1972), before Steve McQueen pummels Bright to get the money back. Additionally, in 1972, he made his first appearance as bodyguard / enforcer \"Al Neri\", protecting Al Pacino in The Godfather (1972), and returned in the same role in The Godfather: Part II (1974) and, 16 years later, he was back once again still protecting mob boss Al Pacino in The Godfather: Part III (1990). Bright's look's have endeared him to casting agents looking for criminals & cops, as he has also appeared in Sergio Leone's Il était une fois en Amérique (1984), Sam Raimi's crazy Crimewave (1985), the union tale Teamster Boss: The Jackie Presser Story (1992) and Witness to the Mob (1998). In addition, he has appeared regularly on TV in police/drama shows such as Hill Street Blues (1981), Houston Knights (1987), Third Watch (1999) and The Sopranos (1999).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0109175","name":"Richard Bright","nicknames":["Richie"],"idIMDB":"nm0109175","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Black Harvest","year":" 1973","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0069793"},{"title":"Day on Fire","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0814072"},{"title":"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0203259"},{"title":"The Jury","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0398498"},{"title":"Law & Order: Criminal Intent","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0275140"},{"title":"Law & Order","year":" 1992-2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098844"},{"title":"The Sopranos","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0141842"},{"title":"100 Centre Street","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0260596"},{"title":"Dead Dog","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0214619"},{"title":"Trigger Happy","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0287048"},{"title":"Oz","year":" 2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0118421"},{"title":"Broke Even","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0208017"},{"title":"The Photographer","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0240802"},{"title":"Third Watch","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0197182"},{"title":"Getting to Know You","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0171340"},{"title":"Joe the King","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0160672"},{"title":"Anima","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0169557"},{"title":"Jaded","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0116675"},{"title":"Witness to the Mob","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Movie)","Joe (Old Man)"],"imdbid":"tt0153882"},{"title":"O.K.
