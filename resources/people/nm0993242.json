She trained at the \"Conservatoire National Supérieur d'Art Dramatique\", with her first roles being for French TV series between 1997 and 1999, Un homme en colère (1997) and Les monos (1999). Her first feature film was a German production, L'été d'Olga (2002), in 2002 and her second the 2003 French production, Bienvenue chez les Rozes (2003). Her first English speaking feature was as Mary, Queen of Scots, in the 2004 Gunpowder, Treason & Plot (2004) TV movie, for which she won the 2005 FIPA for best actress. Since then she has starred in many films, the most notable being In Bruges (2008) (2008), which is probably the start of her worldwide recognition, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005), Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011), the US TV series Gossip Girl (2007) and the English TV mini-series, Birdsong (2012) (2012).
