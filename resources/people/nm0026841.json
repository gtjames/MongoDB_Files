{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"13 July 1921","placeOfBirth":" Wetumpka, Alabama, USA","bio":"A familiar face to movie audiences in the 1950s, James Anderson's rugged and somewhat sinister good looks made him a natural for westerns, and he appeared in many of them over the years, often as a gunman or hired killer but occasionally as a storekeeper or grizzled frontier scout. He turned in a very good performance as one of the survivors of a nuclear attack in Five (1951) and another as a redneck farmer in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), but it's for his western roles in films and on TV that Anderson is best known.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTM0NjQzMjItZTQwMC00NGM4LTg5OGQtY2Q4ZGE3ZGM3ZmI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0026841","name":"James
