{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"14 May 1952","placeOfBirth":" Chicago, Illinois, USA","birthName":"Robert Lee Zemeckis","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"A whiz-kid with special effects, Robert is from the Spielberg camp of film-making (Steven Spielberg produced many of his films). Usually working with writing partner Bob Gale, Robert's earlier films show he has a talent for zany comedy (Romancing the Stone (1984), 1941 (1979)) and special effect vehicles (Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) and Back to the Future (1985)). His later films have become more serious, with the hugely successful Tom Hanks vehicle Forrest Gump (1994) and the Jodie Foster film Contact (1997), both critically acclaimed movies. Again, these films incorporate stunning effects. Robert has proved he can work a serious story around great effects.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyMTMzMDUyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODA0ODMyMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000709","name":"Robert Zemeckis","nicknames":["Bob"],"idIMDB":"nm0000709","filmographies":[{"section":"Producer","filmography":[{"title":"Mabel, Mabel, Tiger Trainer","year":" 2016","remarks":["(Documentary)","(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt6010216"},{"title":"School for Scumbags","year":" ","remarks":["(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt1170374"},{"title":"The Ark","year":" ","remarks":["(TV Series)","(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt6007392"},{"title":"Allied","year":" 2016","remarks":["(producer - produced by)"],"imdbid":"tt3640424"},{"title":"The Walk","year":" 2015/II","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt3488710"},{"title":"Bound by Flesh","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Documentary)","(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt2357003"},{"title":"Flight","year":" 2012/I","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt1907668"},{"title":"Back for the Future","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Short)","(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt2053329"},{"title":"Real Steel","year":" 2011","remarks":["(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0433035"},{"title":"Mars Needs Moms","year":" 2011","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt1305591"},{"title":"Behind the Burly Q","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Documentary)","(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt1510907"},{"title":"A Christmas Carol","year":" 2009","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt1067106"},{"title":"Beowulf","year":" 2007","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0442933"},{"title":"The Reaping","year":" 2007","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0444682"},{"title":"Monster House","year":" 2006","remarks":["(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0385880"},{"title":"Last Holiday","year":" 2006","remarks":["(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0408985"},{"title":"The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio","year":" 2005","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0406158"},{"title":"La maison de cire","year":" 2005","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0397065"},{"title":"The Polar Express","year":" 2004","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0338348"},{"title":"Gothika","year":" 2003","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0348836"},{"title":"Matchstick Men","year":" 2003","remarks":["(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0325805"},{"title":"Ghost Ship","year":" 2002","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0288477"},{"title":"Ritual","year":" 2002","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0250698"},{"title":"Thir13en Ghosts","year":" 2001","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0245674"},{"title":"Cast Away","year":" 2000","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0162222"},{"title":"What Lies Beneath","year":" 2000","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0161081"},{"title":"House on Haunted Hill","year":" 1999","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0185371"},{"title":"Perversions of Science","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Series)","(executive producer - 10 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt0118426"},{"title":"Contact","year":" 1997","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0118884"},{"title":"Secrets of the Cryptkeeper's Haunted House","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)","(executive producer - 1997)"],"imdbid":"tt0216503"},{"title":"Bordello of Blood","year":" 1996","remarks":["(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0117826"},{"title":"Tales from the Crypt","year":" 1989-1996","remarks":["(TV Series)","(executive producer - 93 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt0096708"},{"title":"Fantômes contre fantômes","year":" 1996","remarks":["(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0116365"},{"title":"W.E.I.R.D.
