At age 15 he played Ebeneezer Scrooge in a local children's theater production of \"A Christmas Carol\", and by 17 was performing professionally in nightclubs and coffee houses. He chose Nashville rather than New York or Los Angeles as a place to pursue his acting career and, with advertising executive John R. Cherry III, turned \"Ernest P. Worrell\" into a cash cow, making commercials for clients ranging from soft drinks to food stores and, eventually, Disney. Even though Ernest's catchphrase \"KnowhutImean?\" became a national craze almost immediately, Jim worked in TV and film for more than a decade before his famous alter-ego hit the big screen in Ernest Goes to Camp (1987).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzNTcxNzgwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjkzOTM2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001815","name":"Jim Varney","idIMDB":"nm0001815","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Atlantis: The Lost Empire","year":" 2001","remarks":["(Video Game)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0313229"},{"title":"Daddy and Them","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0166158"},{"title":"Atlantis: The Lost Empire","year":" 2001","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0230011"},{"title":"Toy Story 2","year":" 1999","remarks":["(Video Game)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0395789"},{"title":"Toy Story 2","year":" 1999","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0120363"},{"title":"Treehouse Hostage","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0165994"},{"title":"Existo","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0134645"},{"title":"Hercules","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0138967"},{"title":"3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0118539"},{"title":"Ernest in the Army","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0129908"},{"title":"The Simpsons","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096697"},{"title":"Blood, Friends and Money","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0272509"},{"title":"Annabelle's Wish","year":" 1997","remarks":["(Video)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0133372"},{"title":"100 Proof","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0124268"},{"title":"Ernest Goes to Africa","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0119068"},{"title":"Duckman: Private Dick/Family Man","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0108755"},{"title":"Snowboard Academy","year":" 1996","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt0117676"},{"title":"Roseanne","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0094540"},{"title":"Toy Story Activity Center","year":" 1996","remarks":["(Video Game)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1114274"},{"title":"Toy Story","year":" 1995","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0114709"},{"title":"Slam Dunk Ernest","year":" 1995","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt0114469"},{"title":"The Expert","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0109760"},{"title":"Your World as I See It","year":" 1994","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0185032"},{"title":"Ernest Goes to School","year":" 1994","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0109739"},{"title":"Ernest Rides Again","year":" 1993","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0106827"},{"title":"The Beverly Hillbillies","year":" 1993","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0106400"},{"title":"Wilder Napalm","year":" 1993","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0108569"},{"title":"Ernest's Greatest Hits Volume 2","year":" 1992","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt0295240"},{"title":"Ernest Scared Stupid","year":" 1991","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0101821"},{"title":"Disneyland's 35th Anniversary Special","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0837115"},{"title":"Ernest Goes to Jail","year":" 1990","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0099512"},{"title":"Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0046593"},{"title":"Ernest Goes to Splash Mountain","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0238206"},{"title":"Fast Food","year":" 1989","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0097335"},{"title":"Hey, Vern, It's Ernest!","year":" 1988","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0193221"},{"title":"Ernest Saves Christmas","year":" 1988","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0095107"},{"title":"Ernest Goes to Camp","year":" 1987","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0092974"},{"title":"Hey Vern, Win $10,000","year":" 1987","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt0383397"},{"title":"Dr. Otto and the Riddle of the Gloom Beam","year":" 1986","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0090968"},{"title":"The Ernest Film Festival","year":" 1986","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt0148110"},{"title":"The Rousters","year":" 1983-1984","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0085081"},{"title":"Knowhutimean?
