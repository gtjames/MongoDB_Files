{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"16 November 1907","placeOfBirth":" Cleveland, Ohio, USA","birthName":"Oliver Burgess Meredith","height":"5' 5½\" (1.66 m)","bio":"One of the truly great and gifted performers of the century who often suffered lesser roles, Burgess Meredith was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1907 and educated in Amherst College in Massachusetts before joining Eva Le Gallienne's stage company in New York City in 1933. He became a favorite of dramatist Maxwell Anderson, premiering on film in the playwright's Winterset (1936). Meredith served in the United States Army Air Corps in World War II, reaching the rank of captain. He continued in a variety of dramatic and comedic roles until being named an unfriendly witness by the House Un-American Activities Committee in the early 1950s, whereupon studio work disappeared. His career picked up again, especially with television roles, in the 1960s, although younger audiences know him best for either the Rocky (1976) or Grumpy Old Men (1993) films. Meredith also did a large amount of commercial work, serving as the voice for Skippy Peanut Butter and United Air Lines, among others. He was also an ardent environmentalist who believed pollution one of the greatest tragedies of the time, and an opponent of the Vietnam War. Burgess Meredith died at age 89 of Alzheimer's disease and melanoma in his home in Malibu, California on September 9, 1997.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMxOTk3MzY2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI3NTMyNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0580565","name":"Burgess Meredith","nicknames":["Buzz"],"idIMDB":"nm0580565","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Ripper","year":" 1996","remarks":["(Video Game)"],"imdbid":"tt0117483"},{"title":"Grumpier Old Men","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0113228"},{"title":"Across the Moon","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0109042"},{"title":"Tall Tale","year":" 1995","remarks":["Old Man (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0111359"},{"title":"The Great Battles of the Civil War","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series documentary)","Gettysburg Star and Banner Columnist (Episode 6)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0320862"},{"title":"Camp Nowhere","year":" 1994","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0109369"},{"title":"Grumpy Old Men","year":" 1993","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0107050"},{"title":"In the Heat of the Night","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0094484"},{"title":"Lincoln","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0104732"},{"title":"Mastergate","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0186336"},{"title":"Night of the Hunter","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0102533"},{"title":"Rocky V","year":" 1990","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0100507"},{"title":"State of Grace","year":" 1990","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0100685"},{"title":"Oddball Hall","year":" 1990","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0100284"},{"title":"The Wickedest Witch","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Movie)","Narrator (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0404553"},{"title":"Full Moon in Blue Water","year":" 1988","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0095186"},{"title":"Hot to Trot","year":" 1988","remarks":["(voice, uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0095326"},{"title":"Mister Corbett's Ghost","year":" 1987","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0087729"},{"title":"King Lear","year":" 1987","remarks":["Don Learo (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0093349"},{"title":"G.I.
