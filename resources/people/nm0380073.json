He is the middle of three children born to Honduran immigrants Jose Maximiliano & Maria Elena Hernandez. He began acting at Bishop Ford High School in order to get out of detention. He continued acting in college where he auditioned and was accepted into the BFA program at the Leonard Davis Center For The Performing Arts in Harlem. He left the program when he was asked to join the Workhouse Theatre in Tribeca. He later was a founding member of the experimental troupe Axis Theatre Company as well as The Hot Box Theatre and Room 203. He's preformed at countless venues around NY including The Public, The Lucile Lortell, The Cherry Lane and many others. Though Theatre was his first love, Film and TV paid the bills. Max has worked with directors Joss Whedon, Mira Nair, Gavin O'Connor, Kenneth Branagh and many others. He has a son named Diego and lives in Pasadena.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDAyOTQ3MDg3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQ0NTcyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0380073","name":"Maximiliano Hernández","idIMDB":"nm0380073","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Hawaii Five-0","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1600194"},{"title":"The Last Ship","year":" 2014-2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2402207"},{"title":"Hand of God","year":" 2014-2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3973768"},{"title":"Sicario","year":" 2015","remarks":["Silvio (as Maximiliano Hernandez)"],"imdbid":"tt3397884"},{"title":"The Walking Dead","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1520211"},{"title":"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.","year":" 2013-2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2364582"},{"title":"Captain America: The Winter Soldier","year":" 2014","remarks":["(as Maximiliano Hernandez)"],"imdbid":"tt1843866"},{"title":"Imperial Dreams","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3331028"},{"title":"The Americans","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2149175"},{"title":"NoiTroba","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt2016254"},{"title":"Marvel One-Shot: Item 47","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt2247732"},{"title":"The Avengers","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0848228"},{"title":"Ringer","year":" 2011-2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1819654"},{"title":"Marvel One-Shot: The Consultant","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt2011118"},{"title":"Warrior","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1291584"},{"title":"The Closer","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0458253"},{"title":"Thor","year":" 2011","remarks":["(as Maximiliano Hernandez)"],"imdbid":"tt0800369"},{"title":"Terriers","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1493239"},{"title":"Southland","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1299368"},{"title":"Hotel for Dogs","year":" 2009","remarks":["(as Maximiliano Hernandez)"],"imdbid":"tt0785006"},{"title":"24","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0285331"},{"title":"Pride and Glory","year":" 2008","remarks":["Carlos Bragon (as Maximiliano Hernandez)"],"imdbid":"tt0482572"},{"title":"K-Ville","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0952665"},{"title":"Numb3rs","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0433309"},{"title":"Shark","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0805666"},{"title":"The Nine","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0801426"},{"title":"The Namesake","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0433416"},{"title":"Mentor","year":" 2006/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0462421"},{"title":"Conviction","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0494186"},{"title":"Law & Order: Trial by Jury","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0406429"},{"title":"Law & Order","year":" 1997-2005","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098844"},{"title":"Law & Order: Criminal Intent","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0275140"},{"title":"The Yards","year":" 2000","remarks":["Bartender (as Maximiliano Hernandez)"],"imdbid":"tt0138946"},{"title":"Raw Nerve","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0192512"},{"title":"Prisionera de amor","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0214365"}]},{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"The Indestructible Jimmy Brown","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt2153981"}]},{"section":"Thanks","filmography":[{"title":"Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)","(thanks)"],"imdbid":"tt3591568"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Noches con Platanito","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4941556"},{"title":"Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt3591568"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/15 03:32:18"}}
