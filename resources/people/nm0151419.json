{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"17 September 1965","placeOfBirth":" Buffalo, New York, USA","birthName":"Kyle Martin Fitzgerald Chandler","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Kyle Chandler was born in Buffalo, New York, to Sally Jeanette (Meyer), who bred dogs, and Edward Chandler, a farm owner. He is of German, English, and Irish descent. Kyle grew up in the small town of Social Circle, Georgia (population 4,500). On the family farm, the only TV station they got was Ted Turner's TBS. Kyle would watch old movies, go out and perform the roles in his backyard. As a drama major at the University of Georgia, Kyle met and was signed by an ABC scout in a 1988 talent search. Kyle says of his first 18 months in LA, \"I poured beer and sold souvenirs at the Museum of Natural History\". (USA Today, 27 May 1994, p.8) But that didn't last all that long - Kyle has worked steadily in television and may be best remembered as the minor league ballplayer \"Jeff Metcalf\" in the 40s drama Homefront (1991) or as \"Gary Hobson\" on Early Edition (1996) with co-star Fisher Stevens. His work on Homefront (1991) led to a role in George Strait's feature film Pure Country (1992), and a small part in Mulholland Falls (1996). Kyle and his wife, Katherine, live in Los Angeles, California with their daughters and their two terriers, Buckley and Otis.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTM5NDM4ODg3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTA3MTk3Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0151419","name":"Kyle Chandler","idIMDB":"nm0151419","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Sidney Hall","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1291566"},{"title":"Bloodline","year":" 2015-2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3520702"},{"title":"Family Guy","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0182576"},{"title":"Manchester by the Sea","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4034228"},{"title":"Carol","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2402927"},{"title":"Robot Chicken","year":" 2011-2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0437745"},{"title":"American Dad!","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0397306"},{"title":"The Wolf of Wall Street","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0993846"},{"title":"The Naughty List","year":" 2013","remarks":["(Video)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt3229036"},{"title":"A Monsterous Holiday","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt3229044"},{"title":"Broken City","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1235522"},{"title":"The Spectacular Now","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1714206"},{"title":"The Vatican","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt2608220"},{"title":"Zero Dark Thirty","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1790885"},{"title":"Argo","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1024648"},{"title":"Super 8","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1650062"},{"title":"Friday Night Lights","year":" 2006-2011","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0758745"},{"title":"Morning","year":" 2010/II","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1320103"},{"title":"The Day the Earth Stood Still","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0970416"},{"title":"King of the Hill","year":" 2008","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0118375"},{"title":"The Kingdom","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0431197"},{"title":"Grey's Anatomy","year":" 2006-2007","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0413573"},{"title":"The Color of Evening","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0139124"},{"title":"King Kong","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0360717"},{"title":"Lies and the Wives We Tell Them To","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0891325"},{"title":"Capital City","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0404855"},{"title":"The Lyon's Den","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0380124"},{"title":"And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0337824"},{"title":"One Life to Live","year":" 1990-2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0062595"},{"title":"What About Joan","year":" 2000-2001","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0278255"},{"title":"Early Edition","year":" 1996-2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115163"},{"title":"Angel's Dance","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0159995"},{"title":"Mulholland Falls","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0117107"},{"title":"Convict Cowboy","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0112719"},{"title":"Sleep, Baby, Sleep","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0114471"},{"title":"Heaven & Hell: North & South, Book III","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0108823"},{"title":"Homefront","year":" 1991-1993","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0101121"},{"title":"Pure Country","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0105191"},{"title":"Tour of Duty","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0092468"},{"title":"Freddy's Nightmares","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0094466"},{"title":"China Beach","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0094433"},{"title":"Home Fires Burning","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0097520"},{"title":"Unconquered","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0098555"},{"title":"Quiet Victory: The Charlie Wedemeyer Story","year":" 1988","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0095945"}]},{"section":"Producer","filmography":[{"title":"Early Edition","year":" 1999-2000","remarks":["(TV Series)","(producer -
