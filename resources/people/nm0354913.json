Unsuccessful, she left New York for Hollywood where she worked as a bit player in a few movies. Georgia's first break came when she was hired for the film The Salvation Hunters (1925). It was from this picture that Charlie Chaplin hired her to play the Georgia, the dance-hall girl who wins Charlie's heart, in The Gold Rush (1925). With a very successful film, Georgia became an instant celebrity and was signed by Paramount Pictures. Her big film with Paramount was The Great Gatsby (1926) where she played the role of Myrtle Wilson. But her career never went anywhere and her last picture would be the silent film The Last Moment (1928). Deemed unsuitable for talkies, she was one of the first to be released.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjU0MzdiZWQtYWI3Mi00ZGQ2LWE5MmUtNDcyZDQ2Yzk2NzgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0354913","name":"Georgia Hale","idIMDB":"nm0354913","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"The Lightning Warrior","year":" 1931","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0022078"},{"title":"The Floating College","year":" 1928","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0018898"},{"title":"A Trick of Hearts","year":" 1928","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0019492"},{"title":"Gypsy of the North","year":" 1928","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0018969"},{"title":"The Last Moment","year":" 1928","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0019072"},{"title":"The Rawhide Kid","year":" 1928","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0019309"},{"title":"A Woman Against the World","year":" 1928","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0019588"},{"title":"The Wheel of Destiny","year":" 1927","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0018562"},{"title":"Hills of Peril","year":" 1927","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0017996"},{"title":"Man of the Forest","year":" 1926","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0017115"},{"title":"The Great Gatsby","year":" 1926","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0016938"},{"title":"The Rainmaker","year":" 1926","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0017307"},{"title":"The Gold Rush","year":" 1925","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0015864"},{"title":"The Salvation Hunters","year":" 1925","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0016310"},{"title":"His Marriage Wow","year":" 1925","remarks":["(Short)","Bridesmaid (unconfirmed, uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0015916"}]},{"section":"Miscellaneous Crew","filmography":[{"title":"Hollywood Party","year":" 1937","remarks":["(Short)","(choreographer - uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0340160"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Unknown Chaplin","year":" 1983","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0158310"},{"title":"Fashion News","year":" 1930","remarks":["(Documentary)","Herself (1928)"],"imdbid":"tt1410233"}]},{"section":"Archive footage","filmography":[{"title":"Chaplin Today: The Gold Rush","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Short documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0404869"},{"title":"Cinema Paradiso","year":" 1988","remarks":["Georgia (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0095765"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/15 03:20:57"}}
