{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"3 July 1969","placeOfBirth":" Munich, Bavaria, Germany","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Born in Munich in 1969, Gedeon was raised bilingual (English & German). He was sent to boarding school in England at the age of 8 and transferred to American high school at the age of 12. Gedeon starred in his first movie (Aunt Maria) when he was 10, his second lead role followed one year later in the American / German co-production Blood and Honor (3 part mini series) as Hartmut Keller. By demand of the American and German Producers each scene was shot once in English and once in German, due to his bilingual upbringing, Gedeon was the only actor who did not have to be dubbed in either version. Gedeon continuously worked in various projects during school vacations until he dropped out of high school after 11th grade. At this time he concentrated on training for 2 years, attending musical school and taking speech and acting classes on the side. In 1988 Gedeon starred, next to Tony Curtis and Birol Head On by Fathi Akin), in the motion Picture Welcome to Germany which marked the beginning of his career as a grownup. Since then Gedeon has acted in numerous films, including Acting it Out (German film award/ Movie and Bavarian Film award/Actor) by acclaimed German director Wortman, Silence like Glass by Carl Schenkel and Making Up (Student Academy Award USA/German Film Award) by Katja von Garnier. He also starred in the internationally successful television series Detectiv Rex (sold to over 140 territories) and Kobra 11 (Action series, sold to over 120 territories). in 2006 Gedeon portrayed Henry Neumann, a Jewish boxer trapped in a boxcar with his family on the way to Auschwitz, in the motion picture The last Train. This challenging part, it seems, was the perfect preparation for the biggest opportunity in his career to date, the part of the Jewish Basterd (Will Wicky) in Quentin Tarantino's new movie Inglorious Basterds.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NDM2MTc0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTc5NTc1NTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0121972","name":"Gedeon Burkhard","idIMDB":"nm0121972","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Rhein-Lahn Krimi: Jammertal","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5894888"},{"title":"Ronny & Klaid","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5065290"},{"title":"Titanium White","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3326992"},{"title":"Mountain Medic","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1177054"},{"title":"Plan B","year":" 2016/II","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6333284"},{"title":"The Devil's Mistress","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4240406"},{"title":"Snowflake","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3130560"},{"title":"Liebe, Diebe, Diamanten","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt5205186"},{"title":"Sfida al cielo -
