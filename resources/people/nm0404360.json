Still in her early twenties, after several years of stock work in New York, she joined Eva Le Gallienne's Civic Repertory Theater where she won critical praise for her title role in \"Alice in Wonderland.\" She came to Hollywood in 1934 under contract with Warners, debuting in \"Happiness Ahead\". She co-starred with Paul Muni in \"The Story of Louis Pasteur\" (1936) and played in many small roles, both in films - e.g., the phoney U.N. ambassador's wife in North by Northwest (1959) - and television (\"Twilight Zone, \" \"Gunsmoke\", \"Perry Mason\") in the 'fifties and 'sixties. She died at Manhattan's Florence Nightingale Nursing Home, aged 94.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RiZjJhMzMtMmM5Yi00ZjZhLTlhYmEtNzJlMTljMDFkNzg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0404360","name":"Josephine Hutchinson","idIMDB":"nm0404360","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Little House on the Prairie","year":" 1974","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0071007"},{"title":"The Sixth Sense","year":" 1972","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0068132"},{"title":"The Partridge Family","year":" 1972","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0065333"},{"title":"The Homecoming: A Christmas Story","year":" 1971","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt1795000"},{"title":"The Waltons","year":" 1971","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0068149"},{"title":"Longstreet","year":" 1971","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0066681"},{"title":"Mannix","year":" 1971","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0061277"},{"title":"Travis Logan, D.A.","year":" 1971","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0066486"},{"title":"Mod Squad","year":" 1971","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0062589"},{"title":"To Rome with Love","year":" 1970","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0063958"},{"title":"Bonanza","year":" 1970","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0052451"},{"title":"The F.B.I.","year":" 1969-1970","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0058801"},{"title":"Rabbit, Run","year":" 1970","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0066274"},{"title":"The Bold Ones: The New Doctors","year":" 1970","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0063874"},{"title":"Then Came Bronson","year":" 1969","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0063955"},{"title":"The Name of the Game","year":" 1968","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0062591"},{"title":"Shadow Over Elveron","year":" 1968","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0063588"},{"title":"Gunsmoke","year":" 1959-1967","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047736"},{"title":"The Rounders","year":" 1966","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0060021"},{"title":"Nevada Smith","year":" 1966","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0060748"},{"title":"Baby the Rain Must Fall","year":" 1965","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0058930"},{"title":"Dr. Kildare","year":" 1964","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0054535"},{"title":"Burke's Law","year":" 1964","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0056745"},{"title":"Kraft Suspense Theatre","year":" 1963","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0056768"},{"title":"Arrest and Trial","year":" 1963","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0056737"},{"title":"G.E.
