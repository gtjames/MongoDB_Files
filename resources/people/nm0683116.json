{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"13 May 1946","placeOfBirth":" Rugby, Warwickshire, England, UK","birthName":"Timothy Peter Pigott-Smith","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"British classical stage and TV actor Tim Pigott-Smith is a familiar face both here and in his native England. A drama major, he graduated from the University of Bristol in 1967 (where he frequently lectures) and made his professional debut two years later with the Bristol Old Vic. Predominantly a stage player in both regional and repertory, he made his Broadway debut in \"Sherlock Holmes\" as Dr. Watson in 1974. Over the years, he has appeared opposite England's theatre royalty including Judi Dench, Helen Mirren, Geraldine James, Margaret Tyzack, and Patrick Stewart. He formed his own theatre company in later years, Compass, and served as its artistic director from 1989-1992. In addition, he has directed several major productions including \"Hamlet\" and \"A Royal Hunt of the Sun.\" He has taken several Shakespearean classics to TV, including his Hotspur in \"Henry IV, Part I\" and Angelo in \"Measure for Measure,\" and delivered impressive performances in such prestigious mini-series productions as \"Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years,\" \"Fame Is the Spur\" and \"The Jewel in the Crown.\" Lesser known for his body of film work, such movies as Aces High (1976), his film debut, Joseph Andrews (1977), Victory (1981), Clash of the Titans (1981), State of Emergency (1986), Remains of the Day (1993), and Martin Scorcese's Gangs of New York (2002) have yet given him that necessary breakout role. Tim is a frequent broadcaster who has recorded many audio books and has published the anthology, \"Out of India.\" He has long been married to actress Pamela Miles and they have one son, Tom, who is a concert solo violinist. He recently scored critical acclaim in \"The Iceman Cometh\" (both London and Broadway), and as Ebenezer Scrooge in \"A Christmas Carol.\" Most recently he graced the stage with Ms. Mirren in the 4 1/2 hour production of \"Mourning Becomes Electra.\"","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzQ4NDAxNDA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzY0NjYxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0683116","name":"Tim
