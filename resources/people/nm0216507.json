His father, Joseph, was a gifted tennis player and World War II veteran. His mother, Patricia, held a key position at Gallup and Robinson in Princeton, New Jersey. Delate was a below-average student for the most part, unless his passion was ignited by such things as sports, sailing, and tennis. After graduating from high school in 1967, he worked in a record store for a year before going into the army in 1968. He spent 1969 in Vietnam as a decorated non-commissioned officer. After addressing a long-time reading problem, he became an above-average student while attending Bucks County Community College, where he discovered theatre, then transferred to Rider University, where he received a BFA with a theatre track in directing and acting. He spent a good part of his senior year at Princeton's McCarter Theatre where he was selected to be a directing intern. He was also nominated for inclusion in the Who's Who of Colleges and Universities for 1975. After college graduation, Delate moved to New York City and spent his first few years adapting, both professionally and personally, to the novelty and pace of the city. Delate's first professional acting work (and his very special association with the New York Shakespeare Festival) began in 1981, when he was cast in both of the plays performed in Central Park that summer - Henry IV, Part I and The Tempest. Other plays followed (including Joseph Papp's Hamlet with Diane Venora), and in 1984-1985, Delate received critical acclaim for his performance in the award-winning play, Tracers, which had successful runs in both New York (NYSF) and London (Royal Court). An abundance of daytime television and commercial work followed. In 1987, William Friedkin cast him in Python Wolf and not long after, David Jones cast him opposite Robert DeNiro and Ed Harris in Jacknife. Theatre, film and television opportunities all combined to help Delate thrive as an actor. He spent three seasons with the River Arts Repertory, and three seasons with Phoenix Theatre Company doing rotating repertory theatre, along with numerous theatre acting stints in and out of New York. One piece of trivia from that time was that Delate got to play the Humphrey Bogart role of Rick in the only sanctioned stage production of Casablanca permitted by Warner Brothers. Delate has had the privilege to work with some of the most talented and creative directors and actors in the industry -- most recently in the acclaimed HBO Season 2 of The Comeback for Michael Patrick King. Brian did 5 episodes with its star Lisa Kudrow. Brave One (directed by Neil Jordan, with Jodie Foster), in Salome on Broadway, directed by Estelle Parsons and elsewhere and in the film, Salomaybe (both with Al Pacino), as well as in My Brother (directed by Anthony Lover), Buffalo Soldiers (directed by Gregor Jordan, with Ed Harris and Joaquin Phoenix), The Truman Show (directed by Peter Weir, with Jim Carrey and Laura Linney), American Wake and Home Before Dark (both directed by Maureen Foley, the latter with Katherine Ross), Sudden Death (directed by Peter Hyams), Far From Heaven (directed by Todd Haynes), Ash Wednesday (directed by Edward Burns), and The Shawshank Redemption (directed by Frank Darabont, with Tim Robbins). Under the aegis of Liberty Studios, Delate has spent the last two years writing, directing and acting in, his first indie feature, Soldier's Heart (with James Kiberd and Cady McClain), which takes a promising look at the prolonged effects of PTSD caused by war, and the healing that's possible. Now near completion, Soldier's Heart will soon be making the rounds of the film festivals. Delate has also co-written the screenplays, Dante's Obsession and War Queen with Eric Pederson. Delate resides in Los Angeles. His daughter Tirsa just graduated with honors from Bryn Mawr College.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0MzY2ODA0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDcxMjU2NTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0216507","name":"Brian Delate","nicknames":["Bri"],"idIMDB":"nm0216507","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Rerun","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4194608"},{"title":"Swamp Shack","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt3798778"},{"title":"The Comeback","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0434672"},{"title":"Unforgettable","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1842530"},{"title":"A Gifted Man","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1820742"},{"title":"The Orphan Killer","year":" 2011","remarks":["John (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt1179071"},{"title":"Wilde Salomé","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0795459"},{"title":"Nice Guy Johnny","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1619037"},{"title":"Soldier's Heart","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1236483"},{"title":"As the World Turns","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0048845"},{"title":"The Favor","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0475268"},{"title":"The Brave One","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0476964"},{"title":"Fireflies","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0881913"},{"title":"My Brother","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0451135"},{"title":"Rent","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0294870"},{"title":"One Life to Live","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0062595"},{"title":"Rescue Me","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0381798"},{"title":"Searching for Bobby D","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0374201"},{"title":"Law & Order: Criminal Intent","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0275140"},{"title":"Honey Trap","year":" 2005","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0485326"},{"title":"American Wake","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0384805"},{"title":"Law & Order","year":" 1993-2004","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098844"},{"title":"Sex and the City","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0159206"},{"title":"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit","year":" 2001-2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0203259"},{"title":"Far from Heaven","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0297884"},{"title":"Ash Wednesday","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0280438"},{"title":"Noon Blue Apples","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0303287"},{"title":"Buffalo Soldiers","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0252299"},{"title":"Lonesome","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0226981"},{"title":"Cat Lady","year":" 2001","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0360458"},{"title":"Wendigo","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0275067"},{"title":"A Dozen Kliks","year":" 1998","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0211338"},{"title":"The Truman Show","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0120382"},{"title":"Home Before Dark","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0116547"},{"title":"The Prosecutors","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0117401"},{"title":"Sudden Death","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0114576"},{"title":"C.P.W.","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0111914"},{"title":"New York News","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0112094"},{"title":"New York Undercover","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0108876"},{"title":"The Shawshank Redemption","year":" 1994","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0111161"},{"title":"Reversal of Fortune","year":" 1990","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0100486"},{"title":"Jacknife","year":" 1989","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0097607"},{"title":"C.A.T.
