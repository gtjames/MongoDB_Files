{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"16 September 1971","placeOfBirth":" Burlington, Massachusetts, USA","birthName":"Amy Meredith Poehler","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"Amy Meredith Poehler was born in Newton, Massachusetts, to high school teachers Eileen Frances (Milmore) and William Grinstead Poehler. Her brother is comedian Greg Poehler. She is of Irish (from her mother) and English, German, and Portuguese (from her father) descent. Amy was first involved with sketch comedy when she joined the group My Mother's Flea Bag when she was attending Boston College. In 1993, she went to Chicago where she studied at Second City and Improv Olympics. There, she met Del Close, who later became the voice of the UCB opening scene. In 1996, she joined the Upright Citizen's Brigade with Matt Besser, Ian Roberts, and Matt Walsh. Later on, the group moved to New York and became a Comedy Central show. The show went on only for three seasons. However, the group stayed together at the Upright Citizen's Brigade Theater. Today, the theater is one of the leading centers for improv and sketch shows. After the Upright Citizens Brigade (1998) sketch show came and went, Amy joined the cast of Saturday Night Live (1975) in 2001. By the end of Christmas break of that year, she became a regularly featured performer. She has brought a slew of great performances on every show, such as impersonations of celebrities such as Kelly Ripa or Sharon Osbourne. When Jimmy Fallon left at the end of the 2003-04 season, Amy joined Tina Fey as a co-anchor for Weekend Update. Her Hollywood star is also growing bright, as she has done several feature films, including Blades of Glory (2007) with her then-real-life husband and Arrested Development (2003) star Will Arnett; and the Farrelly brothers-directed remake of The Heartbreak Kid (1993), in which she stars alongside another Arrested Development (2003) star, Jason Bateman.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM2NDk1OTk1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjMxODcxODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0688132","name":"Amy Poehler","nicknames":["Cool Cat Amy","Crazy Amy","Poehlercoaster"],"idIMDB":"nm0688132","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"The House","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4481514"},{"title":"Wet Hot American Summer: 10 Years Later","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt5669272"},{"title":"Maya & Marty","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt5543284"},{"title":"Sisters","year":" 2015/III","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1850457"},{"title":"A Very Murray Christmas","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4537842"},{"title":"Riley's First Date?","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Short)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt4941804"},{"title":"The Awesomes","year":" 2014-2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2818496"},{"title":"Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4341500"},{"title":"UCB Comedy Originals","year":" 2008-2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3327536"},{"title":"Welcome to Sweden","year":" 2014-2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3463606"},{"title":"Inside Out","year":" 2015/I","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2096673"},{"title":"Parks and Recreation","year":" 2009-2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1266020"},{"title":"Kroll Show","year":" 2014-2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1981538"},{"title":"Half Sisters","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4048584"},{"title":"Parks and Recreation in Europe","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt4311010"},{"title":"The Simpsons","year":" 2005-2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096697"},{"title":"Broad City","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2578560"},{"title":"They Came Together","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2398249"},{"title":"Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues","year":" 2013","remarks":["Entertainment Tonight Reporter (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt1229340"},{"title":"Free Birds","year":" 2013","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1621039"},{"title":"Are You Here","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1545754"},{"title":"The Greatest Event in Television History","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2496468"},{"title":"A.C.O.D.","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1311060"},{"title":"Louie","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1492966"},{"title":"Parks and Recreation: Dammit Jerry!","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt2691394"},{"title":"30 Rock","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0496424"},{"title":"Napoleon Dynamite","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1743880"},{"title":"Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked","year":" 2011","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1615918"},{"title":"Parks and Recreation: Road Trip","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2138881"},{"title":"The Mighty B!","year":" 2008-2011","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0917551"},{"title":"Broad City","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Series short)"],"imdbid":"tt1948541"},{"title":"Hoodwinked Too!
