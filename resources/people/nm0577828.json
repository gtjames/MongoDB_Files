{"data":{"names":[{"height":"5' 8½\" (1.74 m)","bio":"Joseph was born in the middle of a snowstorm to Joseph and Linda Melito. Joseph is of mixed Italian, and Irish background. He never wanted to act but fell into it almost accidentally. When he was ten casting director Mike Lemon picked him out of thousands of Philadelphia actors during an open call to play the part of young Cole in Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys. Although 12 Monkeys only did modest numbers at the box office Joseph, along with Brad Pitt, were considered the films strong points. Pitt garnered a Golden Globe nod and Melito just narrowly missed out. After that he was cast as Billy in M. Night Shaymalans first ever movie, Wide Awake. Although the movie did poorly again Melito was signaled out for his strong performance. After Wide Awake Melito became disgusted with the movie scene and opted instead to live a normal life in the Philadelphia suburb of Upper Darby.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0577828","name":"Joseph Melito","nicknames":["Joey Melts"],"idIMDB":"nm0577828","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Wide Awake","year":" 1998","remarks":["Billy (as Joseph Melito Jr.)"],"imdbid":"tt0120510"},{"title":"Twelve Monkeys","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0114746"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of Twelve Monkeys","year":" 1996","remarks":["(Video documentary)","Himself (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0116479"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/15 05:01:33"}}
