After starring in the stage version of 'Kes' - as Billy Casper, he won the Best Actor under 21 award at the renowned Grange Arts Centre - Oldham, at the age of 13. At this time he was also a popular and leading actor at Oldham Theatre Workshop, under the guidance of David Johnson. At 15, Stuart landed his first role as Craig the paperboy in Coronation Street and also the BBC One children's drama Jossy's Giants. He spent his teenage years learning his craft in Local Rep in theatres such as; Coliseum Theatre, Contact Theatre and Library Theatre in a wide range of productions. When Stuart was 17 he landed a role in the BBC film 'My Kingdom for a horse' written by John Godber, as Bobby Shaw. He starred opposite Sean Bean and Sheila Hancock. In 1989, while filming 'Making Out' for BBC he got his big break when Granada called to say he had won the part of Mark Casey in Coronation Street. He loved being part of Corrie and went on to play the character for 3 years until 1992. His highlight was being asked to do the Royal Command Performance in 1990, as part of their 30th Anniversary. In Stuart's 28 year career he has gone from strength to strength working in TV on shows such as; 'Clocking Off', 'Fat Friends', 'Blue Murder' to name but a few. More recently he appeared in the critically acclaimed Jimmy McGovern drama 'Accused'. His film career started back in 1992, when he auditioned for Jim Sheridan, and won a role in the powerful, political film 'In the Name of the Father'. Stuart is a huge fan of British directors such as; Jim Sheridan, Ken Loach and Shane Meadows. His passion for films grew and in 2003 he was lucky enough to audition for Shane Meadows. His character 'Herbie' in the cult, award-winning film 'Dead Mans Shoes' has become one of his most recognised roles to date. Stuart recently auditioned again for the great Ken Loach, who was kind enough to send his audition tape to his son Jim Loach which lead to him being cast in the 2011 film 'Oranges and Sunshine', playing the character Bill. The film, a true story, starring Emily Watson and Hugo Weaving is receiving great reviews and media attention.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0938176","name":"Stuart Wolfenden","idIMDB":"nm0938176","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Elevator Gods","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2139845"},{"title":"Rough and Ready","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1527829"},{"title":"This Is England '90","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2528254"},{"title":"Coronation Street","year":" 1989-2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0053494"},{"title":"Bullet Hole","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt3905862"},{"title":"Prisoners Wives","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2188249"},{"title":"Emmerdale","year":" 2010-2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0068069"},{"title":"The Other Child","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt1919148"},{"title":"The Eschatrilogy: Book of the Dead","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2151849"},{"title":"Best Laid Plans","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1764198"},{"title":"Nightmare in Suburbia","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt1426952"},{"title":"Accused","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1769411"},{"title":"The Dinner Party","year":" 2010/II","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1792629"},{"title":"Oranges and Sunshine","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1438216"},{"title":"SoulBoy","year":" 2010","remarks":["Keeler (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt1259227"},{"title":"Heartbeat","year":" 1992-2009","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0101114"},{"title":"Summer","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1198144"},{"title":"The Royal","year":" 2008","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0313122"},{"title":"Blue Murder","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0364797"},{"title":"New Street Law","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0770620"},{"title":"Derek","year":" 2005","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt4933718"},{"title":"Christmas Lights","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0440205"},{"title":"Conviction","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0412107"},{"title":"Max & Paddy's Road to Nowhere","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0421033"},{"title":"Outlaws","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0426341"},{"title":"Dead Man's Shoes","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0419677"},{"title":"Fat Friends","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0264246"},{"title":"Clocking Off","year":" 2000-2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0243183"},{"title":"Mersey Beat","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0289817"},{"title":"At Home with the Braithwaites","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0231012"},{"title":"City Central","year":" 1998-2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0147756"},{"title":"Stanton Blues","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0180347"},{"title":"Prime Suspect 5: Errors of Judgement","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115321"},{"title":"Bob's Weekend","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0126218"},{"title":"Au nom du père","year":" 1993","remarks":["Soldier (as Stuart Wolvenden)"],"imdbid":"tt0107207"},{"title":"Crazy Hong Kong","year":" 1993","remarks":["British Officer (as Stuart Wolfendale)"],"imdbid":"tt0107102"},{"title":"A Time to Dance","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0103567"},{"title":"My Kingdom for a Horse","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Series)","Bobby Shaw (1991)"],"imdbid":"tt0140754"},{"title":"Making Out","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096645"}]},{"section":"Thanks","filmography":[{"title":"Far Flung Floyd","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)","(the producers wish to thank - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0423649"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"This Morning","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0181261"},{"title":"Happy Birthday, Coronation Street!","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt1093829"},{"title":"The Royal Variety Performance 1989","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0930613"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.7","serverTime":"2017/01/16 05:53:10"}}
