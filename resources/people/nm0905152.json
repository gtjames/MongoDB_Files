Lilly was educated at Kellogg Elementary School in Chicago, before moving on to Whitney Young High School. After graduating from high school, she attended Emerson College in Boston, but dropped out. Lilly teamed up with her older sibling Lana Wachowski (formerly Larry) and began working on films. Their first script was optioned, and formed the basis for the film Assassins (1995). The Wachowskis went on to make their directorial debut with the self-written Bound (1996), which was well received. They followed this with the smash-hit The Matrix (1999) and went on to produce two successful sequels, The Matrix Reloaded (2003) and Matrix Revolutions (2003). Other projects include scripting and producing the cult hit V for Vendetta (2005), a live action version of a Japanese anime series, Speed Racer (2008), Cloud Atlas (2012) and the ambitious epic Jupiter Ascending (2015).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1Mjc1MjkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTc1NDQ1ODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0905152","name":"Lilly Wachowski","idIMDB":"nm0905152","filmographies":[{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"Sense8","year":" ","remarks":["(TV Series)","(created by -
