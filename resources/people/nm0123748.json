Boxing in such avenues as Palm Springs, Los Angeles, and Hollywood, California, the 6 feet 200 pound Burton knocked-out among others, Bob Smith and Denny Chaney. His most important match was an April 4, 1959 6th round knockout defeat at the hands of undefeated Lamar Clark at Palm Springs, California. Clark was the 10th rated heavyweight and had won 38 straight knockouts. Burton gave as good as he got for 5 rounds, but Clark's relentless mauling style finally wore him down.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEwMDY1NTEzNjJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDY0MTA0MDg@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0123748","name":"Tony Burton","nicknames":["Hollywood"],"idIMDB":"nm0123748","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"The Truth About the War in Heaven: Declaration of War","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3294342"},{"title":"Hack!","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0475289"},{"title":"Boxing Bloopers","year":" 2007","remarks":["(Video short)","(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt3125766"},{"title":"Rocky Balboa","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0479143"},{"title":"Shade","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0323939"},{"title":"Exorcism","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0340103"},{"title":"The Lot","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0211157"},{"title":"Knockout","year":" 2000/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0143344"},{"title":"The Magnificent Seven","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0129695"},{"title":"Farticus","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0129228"},{"title":"Flipping","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0116323"},{"title":"Chicago Hope","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0108724"},{"title":"Poltergeist, les aventuriers du surnaturel","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115317"},{"title":"Black Rose of Harlem","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0112518"},{"title":"NYPD Blue","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106079"},{"title":"Fatal Choice","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0144910"},{"title":"Cyber-Tracker 2","year":" 1995","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt0112762"},{"title":"Private Obsession","year":" 1995","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt0114187"},{"title":"Renegade","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0103524"},{"title":"The Bulkin Trail","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0286526"},{"title":"Mission of Justice","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0104888"},{"title":"Hook","year":" 1991","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0102057"},{"title":"Life Goes On","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096635"},{"title":"House Party 2","year":" 1991","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0102065"},{"title":"Twin Peaks","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098936"},{"title":"Rocky V","year":" 1990","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0100507"},{"title":"Over My Dead Body","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098884"},{"title":"Equal Justice","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098789"},{"title":"Side Out","year":" 1990","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0100613"},{"title":"A Different World","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0092339"},{"title":"In the Heat of the Night","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0094484"},{"title":"Amen","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0090395"},{"title":"Police Story: Cop Killer","year":" 1988","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0095884"},{"title":"Frank's Place","year":" 1987-1988","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0092354"},{"title":"Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color","year":" 1987","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0046593"},{"title":"On Fire","year":" 1987","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0093672"},{"title":"Oceans of Fire","year":" 1986","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0091665"},{"title":"Armed and Dangerous","year":" 1986","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0090660"},{"title":"The Paper Chase","year":" 1986","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0077058"},{"title":"The Fall Guy","year":" 1982-1986","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0081859"},{"title":"Supercopter","year":" 1986","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0086662"},{"title":"Rocky IV","year":" 1985","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0089927"},{"title":"Beyond Reason","year":" 1985","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0075745"},{"title":"Heart of a Champion: The Ray Mancini Story","year":" 1985","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0089261"},{"title":"Moonlighting","year":" 1985","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0088571"},{"title":"The A-Team","year":" 1984","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0084967"},{"title":"Happy","year":" 1983","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0087381"},{"title":"The Toy","year":" 1982","remarks":["(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0084809"},{"title":"T.J.
