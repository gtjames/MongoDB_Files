When Ronald was three the family moved from Pittsburgh to Los Angeles where he grew up. He attended UCLA for two years and in the mid-1960s began producing stage plays. Over the next few years he wrote several stories for publication, including the ideas for screenplays and in 1974 he met Dan O' Bannon, with whom he would write 'Alien' and 'Total Recall', subsequently contributing to other films largely in the horror genre.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0795953","name":"Ronald Shusett","idIMDB":"nm0795953","filmographies":[{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"Untitled Neill Blomkamp/Alien Project","year":" ","remarks":["(characters)"],"imdbid":"tt4462546"},{"title":"Total Recall","year":" 2012/I","remarks":["(based on the motion picture \"Total Recall\", screen story by)","/ (based on the motion picture \"Total Recall\", screenplay by)","/ (screen story by)"],"imdbid":"tt1386703"},{"title":"Prometheus","year":" 2012/I","remarks":["(elements)"],"imdbid":"tt1446714"},{"title":"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem","year":" 2007","remarks":["(\"Alien\" characters)"],"imdbid":"tt0758730"},{"title":"AVP: Alien vs. Predator","year":" 2004","remarks":["(\"Alien\" characters)","/ (screen story)"],"imdbid":"tt0370263"},{"title":"Batman: Dead End","year":" 2003","remarks":["(Short)","(characters: Alien - uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0374526"},{"title":"Alien: Resurrection","year":" 1997","remarks":["(characters)"],"imdbid":"tt0118583"},{"title":"Hemoglobin","year":" 1997","remarks":["(written by)"],"imdbid":"tt0119279"},{"title":"Alien vs. Predator","year":" 1994","remarks":["(Video Game)","(character: Alien - uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt5809162"},{"title":"Alien vs. Predator","year":" 1993","remarks":["(Video Game)","(characters)"],"imdbid":"tt0471072"},{"title":"Alien³","year":" 1992","remarks":["(Video Game)","(characters)"],"imdbid":"tt0291715"},{"title":"Alien 3","year":" 1992","remarks":["(characters)"],"imdbid":"tt0103644"},{"title":"Freejack","year":" 1992","remarks":["(screen story)","/ (screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0104299"},{"title":"Total Recall","year":" 1990","remarks":["(screen story)","/ (screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0100802"},{"title":"Above the Law","year":" 1988","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0094602"},{"title":"King Kong Lives","year":" 1986","remarks":["(screenplay)","/ (story)"],"imdbid":"tt0091344"},{"title":"Aliens","year":" 1986","remarks":["(characters)"],"imdbid":"tt0090605"},{"title":"The Final Terror","year":" 1983","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0082379"},{"title":"Dead & Buried","year":" 1981","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0082242"},{"title":"Phobia","year":" 1980","remarks":["(story)"],"imdbid":"tt0081334"},{"title":"Alien","year":" 1979","remarks":["(story)"],"imdbid":"tt0078748"},{"title":"W","year":" 1974","remarks":["(story)"],"imdbid":"tt0072386"}]},{"section":"Producer","filmography":[{"title":"Minority Report","year":" 2002","remarks":["(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0181689"},{"title":"Freejack","year":" 1992","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0104299"},{"title":"Total Recall","year":" 1990","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0100802"},{"title":"King Kong Lives","year":" 1986","remarks":["(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0091344"},{"title":"Dead & Buried","year":" 1981","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0082242"},{"title":"Alien","year":" 1979","remarks":["(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0078748"}]},{"section":"Miscellaneous Crew","filmography":[{"title":"Prometheus","year":" 2012/I","remarks":["(based on elements created by)"],"imdbid":"tt1446714"}]},{"section":"Thanks","filmography":[{"title":"Jodorowsky's Dune","year":" 2013","remarks":["(Documentary)","(special thanks - as Ron Shusett)"],"imdbid":"tt1935156"},{"title":"The 'Alien' Saga","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)","(acknowledgment: still photographs courtesy of)"],"imdbid":"tt0342036"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Tales from the Script","year":" 2009","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt1045642"},{"title":"The Beast Within: The Making of 'Alien'","year":" 2003","remarks":["(Video documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0387056"},{"title":"Biography","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0092322"},{"title":"The 'Alien' Saga","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)","Himself (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0342036"},{"title":"Imagining 'Total Recall'","year":" 2001","remarks":["(Video documentary short)","Himself (as Ron Shusett)"],"imdbid":"tt0305666"},{"title":"Alien Evolution","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0297720"},{"title":"The Alien Legacy","year":" 1999","remarks":["(Video documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0243753"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/15 06:03:30"}}
