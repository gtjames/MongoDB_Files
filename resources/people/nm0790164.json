Although he received few significant roles, he was outstanding in None But the Lonely Heart (1944) as Ike Weber and in The Stranger (1946) as Gen. Meinike, where his character dominates the first 15 minutes of the film. His performance in Danny Kaye's The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947) is also highly regarded. His performance in For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943) was considered outstanding, but was cut from the release print. Not an ambitious actor, Shayne was dedicated to his family, including his second wife, Marjorie.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0790164","name":"Konstantin Shayne","idIMDB":"nm0790164","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Joy in the Morning","year":" 1965","remarks":["Mr. Hoffman (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0059339"},{"title":"The Rogues","year":" 1965","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0057782"},{"title":"The Outer Limits","year":" 1963-1964","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0056777"},{"title":"Arrest and Trial","year":" 1963","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0056737"},{"title":"77 Sunset Strip","year":" 1963","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0051247"},{"title":"The Texan","year":" 1959","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0051320"},{"title":"Steve Canyon","year":" 1959","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0051317"},{"title":"U.S. Marshal","year":" 1958","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0051324"},{"title":"Mike Hammer","year":" 1958","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0050039"},{"title":"Vertigo","year":" 1958","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0052357"},{"title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents","year":" 1956-1958","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047708"},{"title":"Ethel Barrymore Theater","year":" 1956","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0048861"},{"title":"You Are There","year":" 1956","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0045458"},{"title":"The Price of Fear","year":" 1956","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0049636"},{"title":"Crusader","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047726"},{"title":"Passport to Danger","year":" 1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0046634"},{"title":"Studio 57","year":" 1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0046648"},{"title":"Rhapsody","year":" 1954","remarks":["Professor Kelber (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0047408"},{"title":"Schlitz Playhouse","year":" 1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0043228"},{"title":"Cavalcade of America","year":" 1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0044248"},{"title":"Treasure of the Golden Condor","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0046457"},{"title":"Mr. & Mrs. North","year":" 1952","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0044277"},{"title":"5 Fingers","year":" 1952","remarks":["Headwaiter (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0044314"},{"title":"The Unknown Man","year":" 1951","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0044166"},{"title":"I Was a Communist for the FBI","year":" 1951","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0043665"},{"title":"The Red Danube","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041788"},{"title":"Angel on the Amazon","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040095"},{"title":"Cry of the City","year":" 1948","remarks":["Dr. Veroff (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0040257"},{"title":"Night Wind","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040645"},{"title":"To the Victor","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040888"},{"title":"Christmas Eve","year":" 1947","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039266"},{"title":"Song of Love","year":" 1947","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039850"},{"title":"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty","year":" 1947","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039808"},{"title":"Dangerous Millions","year":" 1946","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0038448"},{"title":"The Stranger","year":" 1946","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0038991"},{"title":"Her Highness and the Bellboy","year":" 1945","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0037769"},{"title":"Escape in the Fog","year":" 1945","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0037678"},{"title":"The Man in Half Moon Street","year":" 1945","remarks":["Dr. B.A. Vishanoff (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0037046"},{"title":"The Falcon in Hollywood","year":" 1944","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0036810"},{"title":"None But the Lonely Heart","year":" 1944","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0037135"},{"title":"Till We Meet Again","year":" 1944","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0037379"},{"title":"The Seventh Cross","year":" 1944","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0037263"},{"title":"Passage to Marseille","year":" 1944","remarks":["(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0037166"},{"title":"Song of Russia","year":" 1944","remarks":["Wounded Soldier (as Konstantine Shayne)"],"imdbid":"tt0036378"},{"title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","year":" 1943","remarks":["(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0035896"},{"title":"Five Graves to Cairo","year":" 1943","remarks":["Maj.
