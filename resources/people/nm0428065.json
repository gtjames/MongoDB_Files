Jones was born in Birmingham, West Midlands, and grew up in Bournville. Her parents met while working at the Wolverhampton Express and Star. Her father was a journalist while her mother was in advertising. They divorced when she was three, and she was brought up with her brother by her mother alone. Despite this, she has said that her family is \"extremely close.\" Her uncle is actor Michael Hadley. After Kings Norton Girls School, Jones attended King Edward VI Handsworth School, to complete A Levels and went on to take a gap year (during which she appeared in the BBC series Servants (2003)). She then read English at Wadham College, Oxford, graduating with a 2:1 in 2006. While studying English, she appeared in student plays, including Attis in which she played the title role, and, in 2005, Shakespeare's \"Comedy of Errors\" for the OUDS summer tour to Japan, starring alongside Harry Lloyd.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MTIwMzIyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDEyMzg1NDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0428065","name":"Felicity Jones","idIMDB":"nm0428065","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3748528"},{"title":"Inferno","year":" 2016/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3062096"},{"title":"A Monster Calls","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3416532"},{"title":"Collide","year":" 2016/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2126235"},{"title":"True Story","year":" 2015/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2273657"},{"title":"The Theory of Everything","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2980516"},{"title":"The Amazing Spider-Man 2","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1872181"},{"title":"Salting the Battlefield","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt2904626"},{"title":"Girls","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1723816"},{"title":"The Invisible Woman","year":" 2013","remarks":["(as Ms. Felicity Jones)"],"imdbid":"tt1700845"},{"title":"Emily","year":" 2013/IV","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt2582230"},{"title":"Haven't We Met Before?","year":" 2013","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt2704930"},{"title":"Breathe In","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1999987"},{"title":"Like Crazy: Alternate Scenes","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Video short)","(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt6107680"},{"title":"Like Crazy: Deleted Scenes","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Video short)","(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt6107648"},{"title":"Cheerful Weather for the Wedding","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1159922"},{"title":"Hysteria","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1435513"},{"title":"Albatross","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1541149"},{"title":"Page Eight","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt1797469"},{"title":"Chalet Girl","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1487118"},{"title":"Like Crazy","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1758692"},{"title":"The Tempest","year":" 2010/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1274300"},{"title":"SoulBoy","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1259227"},{"title":"Cemetery Junction","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1196204"},{"title":"Masterpiece Classic","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0066684"},{"title":"Chéri","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1179258"},{"title":"The Diary of Anne Frank","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1127205"},{"title":"Brideshead Revisited","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0412536"},{"title":"Doctor Who","year":" 2008","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0436992"},{"title":"Flashbacks of a Fool","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1037218"},{"title":"Meadowlands","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0865546"},{"title":"Northanger Abbey","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0844794"},{"title":"Hearing Things","year":" 2004","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1984168"},{"title":"Servants","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0352098"},{"title":"Weirdsister College","year":" 2001-2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0315093"},{"title":"The Worst Witch","year":" 1998-1999","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0179061"},{"title":"The Treasure Seekers","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0117957"}]},{"section":"Producer","filmography":[{"title":"Emily","year":" 2013/IV","remarks":["(Short)","(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt2582230"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Saturday Night Live","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0072562"},{"title":"Días de cine","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0390699"},{"title":"Extra","year":" 2015-2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0247094"},{"title":"Good Morning Britain","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3644198"},{"title":"Access Hollywood","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0167515"},{"title":"Entertainment Tonight","year":" 2014-2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0081857"},{"title":"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story - World Premiere","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt6323140"},{"title":"Jimmy Kimmel Live!","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0320037"},{"title":"Omg!
