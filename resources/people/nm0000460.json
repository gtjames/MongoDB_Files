{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"19 September 1948","placeOfBirth":" Cowes, Isle of Wight, England, UK","birthName":"Jeremy John Irons","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Elegant and handsome British actor Jeremy Irons was born in Cowes, Isle of Wight, a small island just off the south coast of England. He is the son of Barbara Anne Brereton (Sharpe) and Paul Dugan Irons, an accountant. Young Jeremy didn't prove very fond of figures. A typical islander, he used to go to mainland England only once a year. He wound up being grounded when his family settled down in Hertfordshire. At the age of 13 he enrolled in Sherborne School, Dorset, where he was happy as he could practise his favorite sport, horse-riding. Before becoming an actor, he had considered a veterinarian surgeon's career. He trained at the Bristol Old Vic School for two years, then joined Bristol Old Vic repertory company where he gained much experience working in everything from Shakespeare to contemporary dramas. He moved to London in 1971 and had a number of odd jobs before landing the role of \"John the Baptist\" in the hit musical \"Godspell\". He went on to a successful early career in the West End theatre and on TV, and debuted on-screen in Nijinsky (1980). In the early 80s, he gained international attention with his starring role in the Granada Television serial adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's classic novel Brideshead Revisited (1981), after which he was much in demand as a romantic leading man. He went on to a steady film career. In 1984, he debuted on Broadway opposite: Glenn Close in Tom Stoppard's \"The Real Thing\" and, in the mid-80s, he appeared in three lead roles with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Once described as 'the thinking woman's pin up', he has made his name in thought provoking films such as David Cronenberg's Faux-semblants (1988), for which he won the New York Critics Best Actor Award. He gained a Golden Globe Award in addition to an Oscar for Best Actor in 1990 for his role as Claus von Bulow in Reversal of Fortune (1990) alongside Glenn Close. Among his many achievements, his role as Professor Higgins in Loewe-Lerner's famous musical \"My Fair Lady\" mustn't be forgotten. It was in London, back in 1987. He is married to actress Sinéad Cusack, with whom he appeared in Waterland (1992) and in the Royal Shakespeare Company plays. He appeared with his son Samuel Irons and his father-in-law Cyril Cusack in the film Roald Dahl's Danny the Champion of the World (1989). His son Max Irons is also an actor.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5Mzg2NDY5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQwNzA0Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000460","name":"Jeremy Irons","idIMDB":"nm0000460","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Justice League","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0974015"},{"title":"Red Sparrow","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2873282"},{"title":"An Actor Prepares","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5718046"},{"title":"Monumental","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2762662"},{"title":"Birds Like Us","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3837842"},{"title":"The Batman","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1877830"},{"title":"Assassin's Creed","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2094766"},{"title":"Their Finest","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1661275"},{"title":"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2975590"},{"title":"La couleur de la victoire","year":" 2016/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3499096"},{"title":"Correspondence","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3530978"},{"title":"The Man Who Knew Infinity","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0787524"},{"title":"High-Rise","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0462335"},{"title":"Paul McCartney: Queenie Eye","year":" 2013","remarks":["(Video short)","Jeremy Irons (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt3503498"},{"title":"The Borgias","year":" 2011-2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1582457"},{"title":"Night Train to Lisbon","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1654523"},{"title":"Life on Fire: Wildlife on the Volcano's Edge","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2776240"},{"title":"Beautiful Creatures","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1559547"},{"title":"The Hollow Crown","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2262456"},{"title":"The Simpsons","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096697"},{"title":"The Words","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1840417"},{"title":"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0203259"},{"title":"Margin Call","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1615147"},{"title":"The Majestic Plastic Bag","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Short)","Narrator (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1823756"},{"title":"Arena","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0199184"},{"title":"The Magic 7","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0113735"},{"title":"Georgia O'Keeffe","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt1320286"},{"title":"The Pink Panther 2","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0838232"},{"title":"Appaloosa","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0800308"},{"title":"The Color of Magic","year":" 2008","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1079959"},{"title":"Eragon","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0449010"},{"title":"Inland Empire","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0460829"},{"title":"Elizabeth I","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0465326"},{"title":"Casanova","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0402894"},{"title":"Kingdom of Heaven","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0320661"},{"title":"Mathilde","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0339368"},{"title":"Adorable Julia","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0340012"},{"title":"The Merchant of Venice","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0379889"},{"title":"Freedom: A History of Us","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0361185"},{"title":"Callas Forever","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0274407"},{"title":"And Now...
