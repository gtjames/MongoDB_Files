{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"10 June 1964","placeOfBirth":" Paraparaumu, New Zealand","bio":"New Zealand-born screenwriter-director Andrew Niccol began his career in London, successfully directing TV commercials before moving to Los Angeles in order to make films \"longer than 60 seconds.\" He interested high-powered producer Scott Rudin in his The Truman Show (1998) script, but Rudin was not willing to gamble on a rookie director, particularly when Jim Carrey came aboard, swelling the budget to about $60 million. Peter Weir helmed instead, bringing a complementary vision which lightened the material somewhat, and the clever satire, which followed a cheerful insurance man (Carrey) as he slowly realizes that all the people in his life are just actors in a TV show, opened to critical raves. Since the deal for \"Truman\" came together slowly, Niccol actually made his screenwriting and directing debut with Gattaca (1997) (1997), a superb, well-acted sci-fi movie that raised issues of genetic engineering in a totalitarian environment.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5ODQ2ODU2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjM2NDg5Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0629272","name":"Andrew Niccol","idIMDB":"nm0629272","filmographies":[{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"Anon","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5397194"},{"title":"Monopoly","year":" ","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt1204976"},{"title":"Good Kill","year":" 2014","remarks":["(written by)"],"imdbid":"tt3297330"},{"title":"The Host","year":" 2013","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt1517260"},{"title":"The Minutes","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Video short)","(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt2673194"},{"title":"In Time","year":" 2011","remarks":["(written by)"],"imdbid":"tt1637688"},{"title":"Lord of War","year":" 2005","remarks":["(written by)"],"imdbid":"tt0399295"},{"title":"The Terminal","year":" 2004","remarks":["(story)"],"imdbid":"tt0362227"},{"title":"S1m0ne","year":" 2002","remarks":["(written by)"],"imdbid":"tt0258153"},{"title":"The Truman Show","year":" 1998","remarks":["(written by)"],"imdbid":"tt0120382"},{"title":"Gattaca","year":" 1997","remarks":["(written by)"],"imdbid":"tt0119177"}]},{"section":"Director","filmography":[{"title":"Anon","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5397194"},{"title":"Good Kill","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3297330"},{"title":"The Host","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1517260"},{"title":"The Minutes","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Video short)","(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt2673194"},{"title":"In Time","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1637688"},{"title":"Lord of War","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0399295"},{"title":"S1m0ne","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0258153"},{"title":"Gattaca","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0119177"}]},{"section":"Producer","filmography":[{"title":"Anon","year":" 2017","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt5397194"},{"title":"Good Kill","year":" 2014","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt3297330"},{"title":"In Time","year":" 2011","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt1637688"},{"title":"Lord of War","year":" 2005","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0399295"},{"title":"The Terminal","year":" 2004","remarks":["(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0362227"},{"title":"S1m0ne","year":" 2002","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0258153"},{"title":"The Truman Show","year":" 1998","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0120382"}]},{"section":"Thanks","filmography":[{"title":"Making a Killing: Inside the International Arms Trade","year":" 2006","remarks":["(Video documentary short)","(special thanks)"],"imdbid":"tt0778772"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"The Making of 'Lord of War'","year":" 2006","remarks":["(Video documentary short)"],"imdbid":"tt0778774"},{"title":"In Time: The Minutes","year":" 2005","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt5293292"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/15 05:15:39"}}
