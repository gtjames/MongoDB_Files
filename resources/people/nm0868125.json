{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"17 February 1964","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","bio":"A native New Yorker who lives in Los Angeles, Angelica continues to balance her contribution to theater, film and television-in that order. Developing many works at the legendary Actors Studio in New York where she is a lifetime member and serves on its board of directors, Angelica mounted Eugene O'Neill's classic \"Anna Christie\" and tackled the title role under the direction of Tony nominated Wilson Milam. Sold out exclusive engagements of the first workshop hailed as \"magnificent\" by Cindy Adams, in New York and Los Angeles have preceded the highly anticipated full production slated for 2013. The award winning solo play \"Edge\" garnered her an Outer Critics Circle Nomination (Best Solo Performance 2003) and has enjoyed critically acclaimed runs in New Zealand, Australia, Texas, Miami (New Times Award Best Actress 2005) and Los Angeles after its triumphant, sold-out run in London. Angelica received The Helen Hayes Award (Best Actress 2000) for assuming the lead role in the Tony Award-winning \"Sideman\" at Kennedy Center. This followed closely after being honored with the New York People's Choice Award in the Best Supporting Actress category (1999) for her portrayal of Patsy, a role she originated for the same production. Nominated for her second Helen Hayes Award (Best Actress 2010) for her critically praised portrayal of Ivy Weston in the Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award-winning \"August:Osage County\" (1st National Broadway Tour), Angelica's performance was heralded as \"revelatory\" by the Chicago Tribune when landing in the Steppenwolf production's home turf. In television, Angelica has made her mark by playing sympathetic tragic figures with seemingly effortless ease as in her role as Julia Brinn in \"Law and Order Special Victim Unit \"(2005). Her final confession was filmed in one take. Her numerous other television credits include \"Law and Order\", \"Criminal Intent\", \"The Sopranos\", \"100 Centre Street\", \"In The Line of Fire, D.C.\", \"As The World Turns\", \"Songs In Ordinary Time\" (CBS), \"Ruby's Bucket of Blood\" (Showtime) and \"Talk To Me\" (TNT). The films Angelica has appeared in have unceasingly stretched her character work as well as her leading lady capacity. In her first film appearance in Robert Benton's \"Nobody's Fool\" (1994), Angelica played opposite Paul Newman in her cameo as Ruby. Leads, supporting leads and cameos followed as she balanced her dedication to her stagecraft with screen work. \"The Sixth Sense\" proved one of the most notable cameos with a screen time of only two minutes for her performance as the emotionally barren Mrs. Collins - a role that has captured the imagination of a generation. Supporting roles include the Polish stuttering prostitute Vitka in Amos Kolleck's \"Fast Food Fast Women\" (2000), the fame hungry waitress Dierdre in the Oscar-nominated \"The Contender\" (2000), smoldering grifter Patty opposite John Travolta in \"Domestic Disturbance\" (2001), and the lust-filled youth hunting Roberta in Michael Imperioli's \"The Hungry Ghosts\" (2009). \"The Mouse\" (1996) opposite John Savage and recently released \"Mint Julep\" (2010), also starring David Morse and James Gandolfini, and \"Lucky Days\" (2010) have secured Angelica's reputation as a transformational force that captures the hearts and minds of directors, critics and filmgoers everywhere. From mousy housewife to mercurial manipulator to love torn virgin, these film roles illuminate her unfathomable versatility and bottomless capacity for emotional depth. \"Lucky Days\" marks Angelica's first film produced by her film company. She wrote, co-directed and stars in this debut. Angelica Page who most recently starred on Broadway in \"The Best Man\", is currently developing \"Turning Page\", a new play about her mother, the legendary Geraldine Page which began in development at the Actors' Studio before moving to its exploratory Off Broadway run at The Cherry Lane Theatre. Angelica has also dedicated herself to a book and documentary about her mother to be completed this year. Angelica Page is a lifetime member of the Actors Studio and serves on its board of directors. She is actively involved raising funds for the charities PAVE and The Trevor Project through Musical Momentum, and is developing a foundation for the arts to foster emerging artists.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5OTQ5MjMyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDIxNTM5Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0868125","name":"Angelica Page","nicknames":["Angel","Gagalina","Gaga"],"idIMDB":"nm0868125","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"You Were Never Here","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2039412"},{"title":"Bonds","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4426846"},{"title":"'79 Parts","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1136822"},{"title":"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit","year":" 2005-2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0203259"},{"title":"Mint Julep","year":" 2010","remarks":["Deirdre (as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt1587419"},{"title":"The Hungry Ghosts","year":" 2009","remarks":["Roberta (as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt1225902"},{"title":"The Golden Boys","year":" 2008","remarks":["Melissa Busteed (as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt0882969"},{"title":"Nothing But the Truth","year":" 2008/I","remarks":["Molly Meyers (as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt1073241"},{"title":"Lucky Days","year":" 2008","remarks":["Virginia (as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt1082031"},{"title":"The Grand Inquisitor","year":" 2007","remarks":["(Short)","Lady Di Jesus (as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt1358188"},{"title":"Light and the Sufferer","year":" 2007","remarks":["Marilla (as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt0362822"},{"title":"Line of Fire","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0361200"},{"title":"Capital City","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt0404855"},{"title":"Music","year":" 2003","remarks":["(Short)","Babe (as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt0362892"},{"title":"Law & Order: Criminal Intent","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0275140"},{"title":"Fairie","year":" 2002","remarks":["Morgana (as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt0308244"},{"title":"Law & Order","year":" 1995-2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098844"},{"title":"The Education of Max Bickford","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0285356"},{"title":"Domestic Disturbance","year":" 2001","remarks":["(as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt0249478"},{"title":"100 Centre Street","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0260596"},{"title":"Ruby's Bucket of Blood","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Movie)","Betsy Dupree (as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt0261264"},{"title":"Brooklyn Sonnet","year":" 2000","remarks":["Gina (as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt0187761"},{"title":"Songs in Ordinary Time","year":" 2000","remarks":["(TV Movie)","Astrid Haddad (as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt0227526"},{"title":"The Contender","year":" 2000","remarks":["Dierdra (as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt0208874"},{"title":"Fast Food Fast Women","year":" 2000","remarks":["Vitka (as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt0206742"},{"title":"The Sixth Sense","year":" 1999","remarks":["(as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt0167404"},{"title":"The Sopranos","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0141842"},{"title":"Wrestling with Alligators","year":" 1998","remarks":["Ruby (as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt0139745"},{"title":"The Mouse","year":" 1996","remarks":["Mary Lou Strauss (as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt0118056"},{"title":"Nobody's Fool","year":" 1994","remarks":["(as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt0110684"},{"title":"As the World Turns","year":" 1956","remarks":["(TV Series)","Kit (1997)","(as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt0048845"}]},{"section":"Director","filmography":[{"title":"Lucky Days","year":" 2008","remarks":["(co-director - as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt1082031"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"LPTW 30th Anniversary Kick Off!","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt2270136"},{"title":"The Sissy Gamache Show","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series)","Herself (2010-2012)"],"imdbid":"tt2777518"},{"title":"The King's Head: A Maverick in London","year":" 2006","remarks":["(Video documentary)","Herself (as Angelica Torn)"],"imdbid":"tt1166817"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/15 06:33:41"}}
