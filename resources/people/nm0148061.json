{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"17 April 1929","placeOfBirth":" Harvey, North Dakota, USA","birthName":"Gerald Michael Charlebois","height":"6' 3\" (1.91 m)","bio":"Six-foot-three and weighing in at a lean, mean 215, Michael Forest was a rugged-looking addition to the Roger Corman and Gene Corman's list of leading men during their 1950s heyday. Between Corman films, he was a stage actor who worked in Shakespearean plays and other legitimate productions as classy as his real name (Gerald Michael Charlebois). Born in Harvey, North Dakota, he moved with his family at a very early age to Seattle, attended the University of Washington for a year and then made his way south to the sunnier campuses of San Jose State. Graduating with a B.A. in English and drama, Forest came to Hollywood in 1955 and started acting on TV and on stage at the Players Ring. In 1957, he began to study with veteran actor/acting teacher Jeff Corey, in whose classes Forest first encountered Roger Corman. Forest has also worked extensively on TV and European films.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTcyODIxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM5MTYxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0148061","name":"Michael
