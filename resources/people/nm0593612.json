He was a popular stage and radio actor in the 1930s in New York. His first cinema appearances were in industrial short features, filmed in New York. His first Hollywood role was in Mr. and Mrs. North (1942). After World War II, Mitchell acted in a goodly number of movies, often cast as sardonic, stolid characters. Although dressed as a cliché in the Anthony Mann western, The Naked Spur (1953), he eluded the usual geezer-sidekick persona as an old prospector who falls in with James Stewart as a bounty-hunter after laughing villain Robert Ryan. He received top billing in 1952's My Six Convicts (1952) but musical-goers most admired his screen role as movie-mogul \"R. F. Simpson\" in the classic, Singin' in the Rain (1952). A heavy smoker, Millard Mitchell died too soon of lung cancer at the age of 50.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTE1Njk3NDAwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMxNDMxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0593612","name":"Millard Mitchell","idIMDB":"nm0593612","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Here Come the Girls","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045866"},{"title":"Lux Video Theatre","year":" 1953","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0042123"},{"title":"Eye Witness","year":" 1953","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0045389"},{"title":"The Naked Spur","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0044953"},{"title":"Singin' in the Rain","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045152"},{"title":"My Six Convicts","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0044940"},{"title":"The Day the Earth Stood Still","year":" 1951","remarks":["Voice of General (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0043456"},{"title":"Strictly Dishonorable","year":" 1951","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0044082"},{"title":"You're in the Navy Now","year":" 1951","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0044224"},{"title":"Mister 880","year":" 1950","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0042742"},{"title":"Convicted","year":" 1950","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0042343"},{"title":"The Gunfighter","year":" 1950","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0042531"},{"title":"Winchester '73","year":" 1950","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0043137"},{"title":"Louisa","year":" 1950","remarks":["Photo of David Norton (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0042687"},{"title":"Twelve O'Clock High","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041996"},{"title":"Everybody Does It","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041341"},{"title":"Thieves' Highway","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041958"},{"title":"A Foreign Affair","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040367"},{"title":"A Double Life","year":" 1947","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039335"},{"title":"Kiss of Death","year":" 1947","remarks":["Detective Shelby (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0039536"},{"title":"Swell Guy","year":" 1946","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039878"},{"title":"Mr. and Mrs. North","year":" 1946","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0311545"},{"title":"Slightly Dangerous","year":" 1943","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0036365"},{"title":"Dixie Dugan","year":" 1943","remarks":["Accident Victim (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0035811"},{"title":"Get Hep to Love","year":" 1942","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0034784"},{"title":"The Big Street","year":" 1942","remarks":["Gentleman George (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0034514"},{"title":"Little Tokyo, U.S.A.","year":" 1942","remarks":["George 'Sleepy' Miles (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0034983"},{"title":"The Mayor of 44th Street","year":" 1942","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0035048"},{"title":"Grand Central Murder","year":" 1942","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0034808"},{"title":"Mr. and Mrs. North","year":" 1942","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0033926"},{"title":"The Girl on the Magazine Cover","year":" 1940","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1663681"},{"title":"Trapped Underground","year":" 1938","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1139968"},{"title":"Dynamite Delaney","year":" 1936","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0030093"},{"title":"Singapore Sue","year":" 1932","remarks":["(Short)","Second Sailor (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0022387"},{"title":"The Cheat","year":" 1931","remarks":["Courtroom Spectator (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0021735"},{"title":"A Lesson in Love","year":" 1931","remarks":["(Short)","Freshman (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0151330"},{"title":"My Sin","year":" 1931","remarks":["Trooper (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0022178"},{"title":"Secrets of a Secretary","year":" 1931","remarks":["Policeman (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0022359"},{"title":"What Price Pants","year":" 1931","remarks":["(Short)","Secretary (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0215350"}]},{"section":"Soundtrack","filmography":[{"title":"Singin' in the Rain","year":" 1952","remarks":["(performer: \"Singin in the Rain (in A-Flat)","\" (1929)",")"],"imdbid":"tt0045152"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Dagmar's Canteen","year":" 1952","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0297540"}]},{"section":"Archive footage","filmography":[{"title":"American Masters","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0364151"},{"title":"Talking Pictures","year":" 1988","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt4047986"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/15 05:09:26"}}
