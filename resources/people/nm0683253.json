{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"27 January 1979","placeOfBirth":" Hammersmith, London, England, UK","birthName":"Rosamund Mary Elizabeth Pike","height":"5' 8½\" (1.74 m)","bio":"Born on January 27, 1979 in London, England, actress Rosamund Mary Elizabeth Pike is the only child of a classical violinist mother, Caroline (Friend), and an opera singer father, Julian Pike. Due to her parents' work, she spent her early childhood traveling around Europe. Pike attended Badminton School in Bristol, England and began acting at the National Youth Theatre. While appearing in a National Youth Theatre production of \"Romeo and Juliet\", she was first spotted and signed by an agent, although she continued her education at Wadham College, Oxford, where she read English Literature, eventually graduating with an upper second class honors degree. Pike appeared in a number of UK television series, including Wives and Daughters (1999), before scoring an auspicious feature film debut as the glacial beauty \"Miranda Frost\" in the James Bond film, Die Another Day (2002); when the film was released, she was only 23. Though her debut was a big-budget action film, the film work that followed was primarily in smaller, independent films, including Terre promise (2004), The Libertine (2004), (for which she won the Best Supporting Actress award at The British Independent Film Awards), and Pride & Prejudice (2005), as one of the Bennet daughters. A brief foray into Hollywood film followed with the action flick, Doom (2005), and the thriller, Fracture (2007), but she returned to smaller films with exceptional performances in three films: An Education (2009), Made in Dagenham (2010), and the lead opposite Paul Giamatti in Le monde de Barney (2010). As she continued her stage work in England, Pike appeared in the spy spoof, Johnny English Reborn (2011), and inhabited the role of \"Andromeda\" in the sci-fi epic, Wrath of the Titans (2012). She returned to action films with the female lead opposite Tom Cruise in Jack Reacher (2012). Pike entered into a relationship with a mathematical researcher named Robie Uniacke in 2009. She gave birth to their first son, named Solo, in May 2012. She returned to acting and landed the coveted title role in Gone Girl (2014). The film became a critical and box-office hit, with Pike earning the film's sole Academy Award nomination as Best Actress. She also earned nominations as Best Actress from Screen Actor's Guild, Golden Globes, and BAFTA. She gave birth to her second son with Uniacke in December 2014.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5MjIxMzA1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQwNzU0NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0683253","name":"Rosamund Pike","nicknames":["Ros"],"idIMDB":"nm0683253","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"The Bends","year":" 2018/II","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3466184"},{"title":"The Man with the Iron Heart","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3296908"},{"title":"Entebbe","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5466186"},{"title":"High Wire Act","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4669264"},{"title":"Hostiles","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5478478"},{"title":"Thunderbirds Are Go","year":" 2015-2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3138604"},{"title":"A United Kingdom","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3387266"},{"title":"Massive Attack: Voodoo in My Blood","year":" 2016","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt5540772"},{"title":"Return to Sender","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt2948790"},{"title":"Gone Girl","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2267998"},{"title":"What We Did on Our Holiday","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2725962"},{"title":"Hector et la recherche du bonheur","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1626146"},{"title":"A Long Way Down","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0458413"},{"title":"The World's End","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1213663"},{"title":"The Devil You Know","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0463960"},{"title":"Jack Reacher","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0790724"},{"title":"Wrath of the Titans","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1646987"},{"title":"The Big Year","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1053810"},{"title":"Johnny English Reborn","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1634122"},{"title":"The Organ Grinder's Monkey","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt2066119"},{"title":"Women in Love","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1738340"},{"title":"Made in Dagenham","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1371155"},{"title":"Jackboots on Whitehall","year":" 2010","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0915463"},{"title":"Burning Palms","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1283887"},{"title":"Le monde de Barney","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1423894"},{"title":"Yesterday We Were in America","year":" 2009","remarks":["(Video)","Narrator (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1744675"},{"title":"Surrogates","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0986263"},{"title":"Freefall","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt1320093"},{"title":"An Education","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1174732"},{"title":"The Tower","year":" 2008","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt1210109"},{"title":"Fugitive Pieces","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0765451"},{"title":"Fracture","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0488120"},{"title":"Doom","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0419706"},{"title":"Pride & Prejudice","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0414387"},{"title":"The Libertine","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0375920"},{"title":"Terre promise","year":" 2004/II","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0424365"},{"title":"Die Another Day","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0246460"},{"title":"Foyle's War","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0310455"},{"title":"Love in a Cold Climate","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0278548"},{"title":"Trial & Retribution","year":" 2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1511543"},{"title":"Wives and Daughters","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0215364"},{"title":"A Rather English Marriage","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0164841"}]},{"section":"Soundtrack","filmography":[{"title":"Jackboots on Whitehall","year":" 2010","remarks":["(performer: \"Jerusalem\")"],"imdbid":"tt0915463"}]},{"section":"Thanks","filmography":[{"title":"Lost Angels: Skid Row Is My Home","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Documentary)","(special thanks)"],"imdbid":"tt1426386"},{"title":"Atonement","year":" 2007","remarks":["(thanks)"],"imdbid":"tt0783233"},{"title":"HBO First Look","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)","(special thanks -
