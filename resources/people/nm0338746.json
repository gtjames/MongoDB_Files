Having already performed the role of Audrey in the musical comedy \"Little Shop of Horrors\" (1982). She reprised the role in Frank Oz's film adaptation of Little Shop of Horrors (1986). While Ellen has first and foremost been a product of the stage, we should acknowledge her performances before-the-camera in Talk Radio (1988), Stepping Out (1991), and ABC's adored and well received Pushing Daisies (2007). She played the role of the agoraphobic Vivian Charles.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3OTQ5NDYyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTgzNjcwNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0338746","name":"Ellen Greene","idIMDB":"nm0338746","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"The Untold Story","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3737840"},{"title":"Muddy Corman","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5072154"},{"title":"Love's Last Resort","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6398360"},{"title":"The Walking Dead: Webisodes","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2022190"},{"title":"Hannibal","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2243973"},{"title":"Bunheads","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2006848"},{"title":"Pound Puppies","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1761811"},{"title":"The Young and the Restless","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0069658"},{"title":"Privileged","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt0903009"},{"title":"Heroes","year":" 2007-2009","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0813715"},{"title":"Batman: The Brave and the Bold","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1213218"},{"title":"Pushing Daisies","year":" 2007-2009","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0925266"},{"title":"Out of Jimmy's Head","year":" 2007-2008","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1078463"},{"title":"Re-Animated","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0780126"},{"title":"Fielder's Choice","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0407788"},{"title":"Mystery Woman: Sing Me a Murder","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0433604"},{"title":"Love Object","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0328077"},{"title":"The Cooler","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0318374"},{"title":"Crossing Jordan","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0284718"},{"title":"The X-Files","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106179"},{"title":"Alex in Wonder","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0246228"},{"title":"Suddenly Susan","year":" 2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115376"},{"title":"Jaded","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0116675"},{"title":"Dellaventura","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0118302"},{"title":"States of Control","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0120204"},{"title":"One Fine Day","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0117247"},{"title":"An Occasional Hell","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0117226"},{"title":"Law & Order","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098844"},{"title":"Killer: A Journal of Murder","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0113542"},{"title":"Cybill","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0111932"},{"title":"The Adventures of Pete & Pete","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0105933"},{"title":"Léon: The Professional","year":" 1994","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0110413"},{"title":"Wagons East","year":" 1994","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0111653"},{"title":"Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult","year":" 1994","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0110622"},{"title":"Fathers & Sons","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0104240"},{"title":"Stepping Out","year":" 1991","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0102979"},{"title":"Rock O Rico","year":" 1991","remarks":["Goldie (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0102802"},{"title":"Pump Up the Volume","year":" 1990","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0100436"},{"title":"Dinner at Eight","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0097205"},{"title":"CBS Summer Playhouse","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0346222"},{"title":"Glory!
