{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"30 June 1894","placeOfBirth":" San Bernardino, California, USA","birthName":"Clyde Adolph Bruckman","bio":"Had been out of work and was pretty much broke when he killed himself. He borrowed Buster Keaton's gun and after eating a meal that he could not pay for, shot himself. There are two stories; One says it was in the restroom of the cafe on Santa Monica Blvd, and the other story states he did it in the phone booth. His last real work was directing Buster Keaton on his local Los Angeles tv show on KTTV. This was in the early fifties and it was live. The show ran for just a year, but was popular. KTTV was having money problems and could not keep it on the air. The few tapes that survived show Keaton doing his typical gags, many that had been re-worked from his past glory.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0115669","name":"Clyde Bruckman","idIMDB":"nm0115669","filmographies":[{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"The Bachelor","year":" 1999","remarks":["(1925 screenplay \"Seven Chances\")"],"imdbid":"tt0120596"},{"title":"Stop!
