{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"17 March 1951","placeOfBirth":" Springfield, Massachusetts, USA","birthName":"Kurt Vogel Russell","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Kurt Russell was born Kurt Vogel Russell in Springfield, Massachusetts, to Louise Julia (Crone), a dancer, and actor Bing Russell (Neil Oliver Russell). He is of English, German, Scottish, and Irish descent. Russell landed a part in the Elvis Presley movie, It Happened at the World's Fair (1963), when he was 10 years old. In 1960, Walt Disney himself signed Russell to a 10-year contract. Once his stint as a child actor ended, he spent the early 1970s playing minor league baseball. In 1979, he gave a classic performance as Elvis Presley in John Carpenter's A.B.C. TV movie. He followed with roles in a string of well-received films: Used Cars (1980), Escape from New York (1981), The Thing (1982) and Silkwood (1983). In 1983, he became reacquainted with Goldie Hawn (who appeared with him in The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band (1968)) when they worked together on Swing Shift (1984). The two have lived together ever since. The movie was a failure - as was their next one together, Overboard (1987). During the 1980s, Russell starred in a rash of disappointments: The Best of Times (1986), Big Trouble in Little China (1986) and Winter People (1989). Finally, his career seemed to be seriously stalled. He only landed Tango & Cash (1989) after Patrick Swayze dropped out; Dennis Quaid was the first choice for the part in Backdraft (1991). In the end, these two roles were the key in reestablishing him as a box-office draw. Russell and Goldie Hawn live on a 72-acre retreat, Home Run Ranch, outside of Aspen. He has two sons, Boston Russell (from a brief marriage to actress Season Hubley) and Wyatt Russell (with Goldie Hawn).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3MjkxNzQwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDk4ODM1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000621","name":"Kurt Russell","idIMDB":"nm0000621","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3896198"},{"title":"Fast & Furious 8","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4630562"},{"title":"Deepwater","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1860357"},{"title":"The Hateful Eight","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3460252"},{"title":"Bone Tomahawk","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2494362"},{"title":"Furious 7","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2820852"},{"title":"Art of Steal","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2172985"},{"title":"Touchback","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1628055"},{"title":"Cutlass","year":" 2007","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1107809"},{"title":"Death Proof","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1028528"},{"title":"Grindhouse","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0462322"},{"title":"Poseidon","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0409182"},{"title":"Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0418647"},{"title":"Sky High","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0405325"},{"title":"Miracle","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0349825"},{"title":"Dark Blue","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0279331"},{"title":"Interstate 60: Episodes of the Road","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0165832"},{"title":"Vanilla Sky","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0259711"},{"title":"3000 Miles to Graceland","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0233142"},{"title":"Soldier","year":" 1998/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0120157"},{"title":"Breakdown","year":" 1997/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0118771"},{"title":"Escape from L.A.","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0116225"},{"title":"Executive Decision","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0116253"},{"title":"Stargate -
