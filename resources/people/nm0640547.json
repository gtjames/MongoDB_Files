{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"23 October 1880","placeOfBirth":" Belfast, Ireland [now Northern Ireland], UK","birthName":"Agnes Teresa McGlade","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"Delightful character actress who held her own against such acting heavyweights as Charles Laughton, Boris Karloff, Tyrone Power, Barbara Stanwyck, and Sydney Greenstreet. Often cast by studio heads as comic relief thanks to her thick Irish accent and rubber-faced expressions, most notably in Universal's horror classics, Bride of Frankenstein (1935) and The Invisible Man (1933). Her final role was as the devoted housekeeper in Billy Wilder's Witness for the Prosecution (1957), a role she originated on stage. Her hilarious testimony during the trial is one of the film's highlights.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA3MjAwNTU2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTkzODMxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0640547","name":"Una
