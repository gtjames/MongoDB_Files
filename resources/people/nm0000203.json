{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"23 August 1970","placeOfBirth":" Madras, Oregon, USA","birthName":"River Jude Bottom","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"River Phoenix was born River Jude Bottom in Madras, Oregon. His mother, Arlyn (Dunetz), a Bronx-born secretary, and his father, John Bottom, a carpenter, met in California in 1968. They worked as itinerant fruit pickers, and later joined the Children of God religious group (John was originally Catholic, while Arlyn was born Jewish). By the time River was two, they were living in South America, where John was the sect's Archbishop of Venezuela. They later left the group and, in 1977, moved back to the United States, changing their last name to \"Phoenix\". They lived with River's maternal grandparents in Florida, and later moved to Los Angeles. His parents encouraged all of their children to get into movies and, by age ten, River was acting professionally on TV. His film debut was in Explorers (1985), followed rapidly by box-office successes with Stand by Me (1986) and The Mosquito Coast (1986), and as young Indiana in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989). His role as Danny Pope in Running on Empty (1988) earned him an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor. His best role was probably Mike, the hustler in My Own Private Idaho (1991). A dedicated animal-rights activist and environmentalist, River was a strict vegetarian and a member of PeTA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals). River was a talented musician as well as an actor, and he played guitar, sang, and wrote songs for his band, Aleka's Attic, which also included his sister Rain Phoenix, while living in Gainsville, Florida. Although the band never released its own album, their song \"Across the Way\" can be found on PeTA's \"Tame Yourself\" album, used to fight animal abuse. River was in the middle of filming Dark Blood (2012), playing the character Boy when he died. The film couldn't be finished due to too many unfilmed crucial scenes. His mother was later sued. River died of acute multiple drug intoxication involving lethal levels of cocaine and morphine at age 23 outside the Viper Room, Johnny Depp's Los Angeles club.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1MTcwMzc2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTUyNDI2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000203","name":"River Phoenix","nicknames":["Rio","Riv"],"idIMDB":"nm0000203","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Dark Blood","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0293069"},{"title":"The Thing Called Love","year":" 1993","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0108327"},{"title":"Le gardien des esprits","year":" 1993","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0108135"},{"title":"Sneakers","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0105435"},{"title":"Dogfight","year":" 1991","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0101748"},{"title":"My Own Private Idaho","year":" 1991","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0102494"},{"title":"I Love You to Death","year":" 1990","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0099819"},{"title":"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade","year":" 1989","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0097576"},{"title":"Running on Empty","year":" 1988","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0096018"},{"title":"Little Nikita","year":" 1988","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0095532"},{"title":"A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon","year":" 1988","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0095736"},{"title":"The Mosquito Coast","year":" 1986","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0091557"},{"title":"Circle of Violence: A Family Drama","year":" 1986","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0090846"},{"title":"Stand by Me","year":" 1986","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0092005"},{"title":"Family Ties","year":" 1985","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0083413"},{"title":"Explorers","year":" 1985","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0089114"},{"title":"Surviving","year":" 1985","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0090106"},{"title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","year":" 1985","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0088594"},{"title":"Hotel","year":" 1984","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0085032"},{"title":"It's Your Move","year":" 1984","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0086737"},{"title":"ABC Afterschool Specials","year":" 1984","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0202179"},{"title":"Celebrity","year":" 1984","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0086679"},{"title":"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers","year":" 1982-1983","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0083476"}]},{"section":"Soundtrack","filmography":[{"title":"The Thing Called Love","year":" 1993","remarks":["(performer: \"STANDING ON A ROCK\", \"UNTIL NOW\", \"BLAME IT ON YOUR HEART\", \"LONE STAR STATE OF MINE\", \"OL' JOHN AND JIMMY\", \"LOST HIGHWAY\", \"LOVE IS\")","/ (writer: \"LONE STAR STATE OF MINE\")"],"imdbid":"tt0108327"},{"title":"Stand by Me","year":" 1986","remarks":["(performer: \"The Ballad of Paladin\")"],"imdbid":"tt0092005"},{"title":"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers","year":" 1983","remarks":["(TV Series)","(performer -
