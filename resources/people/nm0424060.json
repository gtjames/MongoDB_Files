{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"22 November 1984","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Scarlett Ingrid Johansson","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Scarlett Johansson was born in New York City. Her mother, Melanie Sloan, is from an Ashkenazi Jewish family, and her father, Karsten Johansson, is Danish. She has a sister, Vanessa Johansson, who is also an actress, a brother, Adrian, a twin brother, Hunter Johansson, born three minutes after her, and a paternal half-brother, Christian. Her grandfather was writer Ejner Johansson. Johansson began acting during childhood, after her mother started taking her to auditions. She made her professional acting debut at the age of eight in the off-Broadway production of \"Sophistry\" with Ethan Hawke, at New York's Playwrights Horizons. She would audition for commercials but took rejection so hard her mother began limiting her to film tryouts. She made her film debut at the age of nine, as John Ritter's character's daughter in the 1994 fantasy comedy, North (1994). Following minor roles in the 1995 film Just Cause (1995), as the daughter of Sean Connery and Kate Capshaw's character, and If Lucy Fell (1996), she played the role of Amanda in Manny & Lo (1996). Her performance in Manny & Lo garnered a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Lead Female, and positive reviews, one noting, \"[the film] grows on you, largely because of the charm of ... Scarlett Johansson\", while San Francisco Chronicle critic Mick LaSalle commentated on her \"peaceful aura\", and wrote, \"If she can get through puberty with that aura undisturbed, she could become an important actress.\" After appearing in minor roles in Fall and Home Alone 3 in 1997, Johansson garnered widely spread attention for her performance in the 1998 film The Horse Whisperer (1998), directed by Robert Redford, where she played Grace MacLean, a teenager traumatized by a riding accident. She received a nomination for the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actress for the film. In 1999, she appeared in My Brother the Pig and in 2001 in the Coen brothers film The Man Who Wasn't There. Also in 1999, she appeared in the music video for Mandy Moore's single, \"Candy\". Although the film was not a box office success, she received praise for her break-out role in Ghost World (2001), credited with \"sensitivity and talent [that] belie her age\". She was also featured in the Coen Brothers' dark drama The Man Who Wasn't There (2001), opposite Billy Bob Thornton and Frances McDormand. In 2002, she appeared in Eight Legged Freaks (2002) with David Arquette. In 2003, she was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards, one for drama (Girl with a Pearl Earring (2003)) and one for comedy (Lost in Translation (2003)), her breakout role, starring opposite Bill Murray, and receiving rave reviews and a Best Actress Award at the Venice Film Festival. Her 2004 film roles include the critically acclaimed Weitz brothers' film \"In Good Company,\" as well as starring opposite John Travolta in \"A Love Song For Bobby Long,\" which garnered her a Golden Globe nomination (her third in two years). She dropped out of Mission: Impossible III (2006) due to scheduling conflicts. Her next film role was in The Island (2005) alongside Ewan McGregor which earned weak reviews from U.S. critics. After this, she appeared in Woody Allen's Match Point (2005) and was nominated again for a Golden Globe Award. In May 2008, she released her album \"Anywhere I Lay My Head,\" a collection of Tom Waits covers featuring one original song. Also that year, she starred in Frank Miller's The Spirit (2008), the Woody Allen film Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008), and played Mary Boleyn opposite Natalie Portman in The Other Boleyn Girl (2008). Since then, she has appeared as part of an ensemble cast in the romantic comedy He's Just Not That Into You (2009), the action superhero film Iron Man 2 (2010), the comedy-drama We Bought a Zoo (2011) and started as the original scream queen, Janet Leigh, in Hitchcock (2012). She then played her Iron Man 2 character, Black Widow, in the blockbuster action films The Avengers (2012), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), and also headlined the science-fiction thriller Lucy (2014), a box office success. With more than a decade of work already under her belt, Scarlett has proven to be one of Hollywood's most talented young actresses. Scarlett and Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds were engaged in May 2008 and married in September of that year. In 2010, the couple announced their separation, and subsequently divorced in 2011. In 2013, she became engaged to French journalist Romain Dauriac, and the couple, who have a daughter, married in 2014.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3OTUwMDYwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTUyNzc3Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0424060","name":"Scarlett
