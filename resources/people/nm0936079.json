The former Ziegfeld Follies dancer appeared in a good number of films from 1925--if not as the nominal star then, at least, very high up the list of credits. Her aloof beauty was tailor-made for playing patrician socialites and she breezed through many such roles in both comedy and drama. Her most famous role, ironically, was as Donna Isobel in Don Juan (1926), not because of the acting involved (even though the star was John Barrymore), but because it first used the Vitaphone process to synchronize film and sound effects (though no dialogue), effectively making it a precursor to The Jazz Singer (1927), released a year later. At Warner Brothers, Jane appeared back to back in the period drama My Official Wife (1926) and one of the studio's most successful comedies of the year, Why Girls Go Back Home (1926), as a seductive model. She was also third-billed as the vamp rivaling Marion Davies for the affections of Johnny Mack Brown in The Fair Co-Ed (1927), and as Davies' elder sister in her biggest hit, The Patsy (1928). She had smaller roles in two A-grade productions: the classic Sunrise (1927) and the Howard Hughes-produced World War I epic Hell's Angels (1930). At the peak of her career, Jane--at her most glamorous--essayed a murder suspect in The Furies (1930), adapted for the screen by Zoe Akins. Jane's star faded abruptly after 1930. She made a few more appearances in several 17- and 18-minute mystery \"featurettes\", made at the Warner Brothers Vitaphone facilities in Brooklyn. In 1937 she left acting altogether. It is not entirely clear what, exactly, killed off her career. One might logically surmise, that it was the transition to sound pictures, yet the problem was not with the quality of her voice. In fact, she became a soprano of international repute, a one-time diva with the National Grand Opera Company in 1933, performing in \"Pagliacci\". Some years later she also sang on radio broadcasts in England. In any event, Jane went globe-trotting and devoted time to her various other talents. She was said to have been a decent painter and certainly played bridge rather well (a tribute to one of her three husbands, a grand master of the game, Michael T. Gottlieb). In the early 1950s the multi-faceted Jane also wrote two novels: \"Park Avenue Doctor\" and the period romance \"Passion is the Gale\", a tale of \"temptation and torment\" set in the Virgin Islands, featuring pirates, damsels in distress and other expected accouterments of the genre. Jane Winton She died in 1959, aged just 54. As Gloria Swanson famously said in Sunset Boulevard (1950): \"There just aren't any faces like that anymore . . . \".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NzY3MTAyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ2OTY3MTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0936079","name":"Jane Winton","idIMDB":"nm0936079","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Backstage","year":" 1937","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0027888"},{"title":"The Light Fantastic","year":" 1935","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1013920"},{"title":"Hired Wife","year":" 1934","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0025255"},{"title":"The Crane Poison Case","year":" 1932","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0165699"},{"title":"The Week End Mystery","year":" 1931","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0166017"},{"title":"Hell's Angels","year":" 1930","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0020960"},{"title":"A Notorious Affair","year":" 1930","remarks":["One of Paul's Admirers (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0021191"},{"title":"Show Girl in Hollywood","year":" 1930","remarks":["Brunette Actress with Frank Buelow at Premiere (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0021371"},{"title":"The Furies","year":" 1930","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0020910"},{"title":"In the Next Room","year":" 1930","remarks":["The Lady (Prologue)"],"imdbid":"tt0020998"},{"title":"Scandal","year":" 1929","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0020367"},{"title":"The Bridge of San Luis Rey","year":" 1929","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0019722"},{"title":"Captain Lash","year":" 1929","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0019748"},{"title":"Nothing to Wear","year":" 1928","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0019218"},{"title":"Melody of Love","year":" 1928","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0019156"},{"title":"Yellow Lily","year":" 1928","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0019603"},{"title":"Burning Daylight","year":" 1928","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0018733"},{"title":"The Patsy","year":" 1928","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0019258"},{"title":"Honeymoon Flats","year":" 1928","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0019017"},{"title":"Bare Knees","year":" 1928","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0018673"},{"title":"The Fair Co-Ed","year":" 1927","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0017860"},{"title":"The Crystal Cup","year":" 1927","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0017785"},{"title":"Sunrise","year":" 1927","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0018455"},{"title":"The Poor Nut","year":" 1927","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0018272"},{"title":"Lonesome Ladies","year":" 1927","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0018100"},{"title":"The Beloved Rogue","year":" 1927","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0017667"},{"title":"Perch of the Devil","year":" 1927","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0018256"},{"title":"The Gay Old Bird","year":" 1927","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0017920"},{"title":"The Monkey Talks","year":" 1927","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0018170"},{"title":"Upstream","year":" 1927","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0018530"},{"title":"My Official Wife","year":" 1926","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0017185"},{"title":"Across the Pacific","year":" 1926","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0016575"},{"title":"Millionaires","year":" 1926","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0017154"},{"title":"The Honeymoon Express","year":" 1926","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0016981"},{"title":"Don Juan","year":" 1926","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0016804"},{"title":"The Passionate Quest","year":" 1926","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0017255"},{"title":"Footloose Widows","year":" 1926","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0016893"},{"title":"My Old Dutch","year":" 1926","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0017186"},{"title":"Why Girls Go Back Home","year":" 1926","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0017555"},{"title":"The Love Toy","year":" 1926","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0017085"},{"title":"His Supreme Moment","year":" 1925","remarks":["Undetermined Role (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0015920"},{"title":"Tomorrow's Love","year":" 1925","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0016436"},{"title":"Three Women","year":" 1924","remarks":["Charity Ball Guest (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0015409"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.7","serverTime":"2017/01/16 05:52:50"}}
