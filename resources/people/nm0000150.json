{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"9 June 1961","placeOfBirth":" Edmonton, Alberta, Canada","birthName":"Michael Andrew Fox","height":"5' 4½\" (1.64 m)","bio":"Michael J. Fox was born Michael Andrew Fox on June 9, 1961 in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, to Phyllis Fox (née Piper), a payroll clerk, and William Fox. His parents moved their ten-year-old son, his three sisters, Kelli Fox, Karen, and Jacki, and his brother, Steven, to Vancouver, British Columbia, after his father, a sergeant in the Canadian Army Signal Corps, retired. It was during these years that Michael developed his desire to act. At age fifteen, he successfully auditioned for the role of a 10-year-old in a series called Leo and Me (1978). Gaining attention as a bright new star in Canadian television and movies, Michael realized his love for acting when he appeared on stage in \"The Shadow Box\". At age 18, he moved to Los Angeles and was offered a few roles in television series but early acting success ended fast when the roles stopped coming. For a while, he survived on boxes of macaroni and cheese. Then his agent called to tell him that he got the part of Alex P. Keaton on the situation comedy Family Ties (1982). He starred in the feature films Teen Wolf (1985), High School U.S.A. (1983), Poison Ivy (1985) and Back to the Future (1985).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwNzM0MjE4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDkxMzEwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000150","name":"Michael J.
