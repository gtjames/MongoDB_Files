{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"4 October 1967","placeOfBirth":" San Francisco, California, USA","birthName":"Isaac Liev Schreiber","height":"6' 3\" (1.91 m)","bio":"Liev (pronounced Lee-ev) Schreiber was born in San Francisco. His mother, Heather (Milgram), is a painter, and his father, Tell Schreiber (Tell Carroll Schreiber III), is a theatrical actor who had a small role in The Keeper (1985). His mother is from a working-class Jewish family from Poland and Russia, while his father is from an upper-class Protestant family. His parents moved the family to Canada when Liev was one, and divorced when he was five. He and his mother moved to New York, where she drove a cab. During that time, they lived as squatters in abandoned buildings. His mother taught him to read, and she also forbade him from seeing color movies. He grew up seeing silent and black & white movies at a local revival house and particularly enjoyed those of Charles Chaplin. His mother now lives in an ashram in Virginia. He began acting at Hampshire College and continued at the Yale University School of Drama in 1992. He originally wanted to be a playwright, but his teacher encouraged him to become an actor.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5NjI1NzA1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc0ODM3ODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000630","name":"Liev Schreiber","nicknames":["Huggy"],"idIMDB":"nm0000630","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Isle of Dogs","year":" 2018","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt5104604"},{"title":"My Little Pony: The Movie","year":" 2017","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt4131800"},{"title":"Goon: Last of the Enforcers","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2417712"},{"title":"Ray Donovan","year":" 2013-2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2249007"},{"title":"Drunk History","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2712612"},{"title":"The Bleeder","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1610525"},{"title":"Saturday Night Live","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0072562"},{"title":"The 5th Wave","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2304933"},{"title":"Creed","year":" 2015","remarks":["HBO 24 / 7 Narrator (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt3076658"},{"title":"Spotlight","year":" 2015/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1895587"},{"title":"BoJack Horseman","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3398228"},{"title":"Pawn Sacrifice","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1596345"},{"title":"A Perfect Man","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2275471"},{"title":"Fading Gigolo","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2258345"},{"title":"Clear History","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt2279864"},{"title":"Lee Daniels' The Butler","year":" 2013/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1327773"},{"title":"The Last Days on Mars","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1709143"},{"title":"Movie 43","year":" 2013","remarks":["Robert (segment \"Homeschooled\")"],"imdbid":"tt1333125"},{"title":"Robot Chicken","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0437745"},{"title":"The Reluctant Fundamentalist","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2032557"},{"title":"Mental","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1655416"},{"title":"Felt","year":" 2011/II","remarks":["(Short)","Bunny (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1999155"},{"title":"Goon","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1456635"},{"title":"The Daily Show","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115147"},{"title":"Portraits in Dramatic Time","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1978512"},{"title":"Salt","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0944835"},{"title":"America: The Story of the US","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt1641653"},{"title":"Every Day","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1301990"},{"title":"Repo Men","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1053424"},{"title":"Taking Woodstock","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1127896"},{"title":"X-Men Origins: Wolverine","year":" 2009","remarks":["(Video Game)","/ (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1334106"},{"title":"X-Men Origins: Wolverine Character Spotlights","year":" 2009","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt6315030"},{"title":"X-Men Origins: Wolverine","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0458525"},{"title":"Defiance","year":" 2008/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1034303"},{"title":"Love in the Time of Cholera","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0484740"},{"title":"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0247082"},{"title":"The Ten","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0811106"},{"title":"Chicago 10","year":" 2007","remarks":["(Documentary)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0905979"},{"title":"Le voile des illusions","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0446755"},{"title":"The Omen","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0466909"},{"title":"Lackawanna Blues","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0407936"},{"title":"The Manchurian Candidate","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0368008"},{"title":"Spinning Boris","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0324619"},{"title":"Hitler -
