{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"30 October 1957","placeOfBirth":" San Francisco, California, USA","birthName":"Kevin Elliot Pollak","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Kevin Pollak was born in San Francisco in 1957, to Elaine (Klein) and Robert Pollak. A stand-up comedy performer at age 10, he turned professional comedian a decade later and was puttering around from city to city when film roles beckoned. Pollak refocused thereafter on acting in what would be a wise and profitable career move. Landing his first film role in George Lucas' Willow (1988), directed by Ron Howard, became the wind beneath his wings, and he has been sailing ever since. Critically noticed for his role in Avalon (1990), it was Rob Reiner's A Few Good Men (1992) that shot him up the credit's list. Adept at displaying smarmy and/or shady, smug characters, such showy roles in The Usual Suspects (1995) and Casino (1995) were his reward. He co-created and co-executive produced The Underworld (1997) along with actress/writer/partner/wife Lucy Webb. They also appeared together in the movies The Don's Analyst (1997) and Outside Ozona (1998). Not only starring in two of his own HBO stand-up comedy specials, Pollak returned to the live stand-up stage in 2001, headlining a sold out 20 city tour. Most recently, he co-starred with Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry in The Whole Ten Yards (2004), a sequel to the hit comedy The Whole Nine Yards (2000).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjgzMzQzNzg0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI5NjY1OQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001629","name":"Kevin Pollak","idIMDB":"nm0001629","filmographies":[{"section":"Producer","filmography":[{"title":"Borealis","year":" 2015","remarks":["(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt3630652"},{"title":"Kevin Pollak's Chat Show","year":" 2009-2015","remarks":["(TV Series)","(executive producer - 212 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt1524593"},{"title":"Chez Upshaw","year":" 2013","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt2006088"},{"title":"Columbus Circle","year":" 2012","remarks":["(co-executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt1465533"},{"title":"Kevin Pollak: The Littlest Suspect","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt1705116"},{"title":"Vamped Out","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series)","(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt1650366"},{"title":"Work with Me","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Series)","(co-executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0210464"}]},{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"Misery Loves Comedy","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Documentary)","(co-writer)"],"imdbid":"tt3132632"},{"title":"Kevin Pollak's Chat Show","year":" 2009-2015","remarks":["(TV Series)","(writer - 212 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt1524593"},{"title":"Columbus Circle","year":" 2012","remarks":["(written by)"],"imdbid":"tt1465533"},{"title":"Kevin Pollak: The Littlest Suspect","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(written by)"],"imdbid":"tt1705116"},{"title":"Vamped Out","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series)","(creator)"],"imdbid":"tt1650366"},{"title":"The Underworld","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(story)"],"imdbid":"tt0301971"}]},{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Three Christs","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5706370"},{"title":"Axis","year":" 2017","remarks":["Cru (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt4971346"},{"title":"Lez Bomb","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3496790"},{"title":"The Lost Year","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3971010"},{"title":"Hypnotized","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3717378"},{"title":"Soulmates","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2327521"},{"title":"Drunk History","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2712612"},{"title":"War Dogs","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2005151"},{"title":"Angie Tribeca","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3597790"},{"title":"Angel from Hell","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4424726"},{"title":"Special Correspondents","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4181052"},{"title":"The Tiger Hunter","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3853830"},{"title":"Compadres","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3367294"},{"title":"Four Kings","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4585922"},{"title":"The Night Is Young","year":" 2015/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3583382"},{"title":"Camino","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4991652"},{"title":"Borealis","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3630652"},{"title":"Transformers: Robots in Disguise","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3604232"},{"title":"Comedy Bang!
