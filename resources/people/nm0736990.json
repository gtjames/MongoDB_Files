She moved with her family to California at age two and a half. She got the nickname \"Casey\" when her neighborhood playmates discovered how well she handled a baseball bat (\"I could hit a baseball farther than anybody in grammar school except Robert Lewis - he and I were always the opposing captains of the sixth grade baseball teams!\"); she later changed the \"C\" in \"Casey\" to a \"K\". Paramount changed her name to Laura Elliott during her late 1940s-early '50s stint there, but she went back to Kasey Rogers soon after leaving that studio. Twice-married and the mother of four (and a grandmother), Rogers turned her talents to writing and development, including the proposed new TV series Son of a Witch.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTk1MjAxNDcxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjYwOTgxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0736990","name":"Kasey
