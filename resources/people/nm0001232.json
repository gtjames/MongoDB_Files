{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"18 February 1932","placeOfBirth":" Cáslav, Czechoslovakia [now Czech Republic]","birthName":"Jan Tomas Forman","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Milos Forman was born Jan Tomas Forman in Caslav, Czechoslovakia, to Anna (Svabova), who ran a summer hotel, and Rudolf Forman, a professor. During World War II, his parents were taken away by the Nazis, after being accused of participating in the underground resistance. His father died in Buchenwald and his mother died in Auschwitz, and Milos became an orphan very early on. He studied screen-writing at the Prague Film Academy (F.A.M.U.). In his Czechoslovakian films, Black Peter (1964), The Loves of a Blonde (1965), and The Firemen's Ball (1967), he created his own style of comedy. During the invasion of his country by the troops of the Warsaw pact in the summer of 1968 to stop the Prague spring, he left Europe for the United States. In spite of difficulties, he filmed Taking Off (1971) there and achieved his fame later with One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) adapted from the novel of Ken Kesey, which won five Oscars including one for direction. Other important films of Milos Forman were the musical Hair (1979) and his biography of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Amadeus (1984), which won eight Oscars.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY5NDAyODM2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzgzNzg3OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001232","name":"Milos
