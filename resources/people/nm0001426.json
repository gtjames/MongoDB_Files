{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"31 December 1943","placeOfBirth":" Scarborough, Yorkshire, England, UK","birthName":"Krishna Bhanji","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Ben Kingsley was born Krishna Bhanji in Scarborough, Yorkshire, England. His father, Rahimtulla Harji Bhanji, was a Kenyan-born medical doctor, of Gujarati Indian descent, and his mother, Anna Lyna Mary (Goodman), was an English actress. Ben began to act in stage plays during the 1960s. He soon became a successful stage actor, and also began to have roles in films and TV. His birth name was Krishna Bhanji, but he changed his name to \"Ben Kingsley\" soon after gaining fame as a stage actor, fearing that a foreign name could hamper his acting career. Kingsley first earned international fame for his performance in the 1982 movie, Gandhi (1982). His performance as \"Mahatma Gandhi\" earned him international fame. He won many awards - including an Oscar for Best Actor. He also won Golden Globe, BAFTA and London Film Critics' Circle Awards. After acting in Gandhi (1982), Ben was recognized as one of the finest British actors. After his international fame for appearing in Gandhi (1982), Kingsley appeared in many other famous movies. His success as an actor continued. In 1993, his performance as \"Itzhak Stern\" in the movie, Schindler's List (1993) earned him a BAFTA nomination. Schindler's List (1993) won seven Oscars, including Best Picture. During the late 1990s, Kingsley acted in many successful movies. He played \"Sweeney Todd\" in the 1998 TV movie, The Tale of Sweeney Todd (1997). For his performance in this movie, he was nominated for the Screen Actors' Guild Award. His other notable role was as \"Otto Frank\" in the TV movie Anne Frank: The Whole Story (2001), for which he won a Screen Actors' Guild Award. Ben Kingsley lives in Spelsbury, Oxfordshire, in England.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTU2Njg2NzM4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjYwNjQwMTI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001426","name":"Ben Kingsley","idIMDB":"nm0001426","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"An Ordinary Man","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1785288"},{"title":"Security","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3501112"},{"title":"A Doll's House","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2072872"},{"title":"Backstabbing for Beginners","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5153288"},{"title":"Mary","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0949757"},{"title":"War Machine","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4758646"},{"title":"The Ottoman Lieutenant","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4943322"},{"title":"Wake","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3876910"},{"title":"Watership Down","year":" ","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt5670764"},{"title":"Collide","year":" 2016/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2126235"},{"title":"The Jungle Book","year":" 2016","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt3040964"},{"title":"Of Dogs and Men","year":" 2016/I","remarks":["(Short)","The Caller (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt5242176"},{"title":"The Walk","year":" 2015/II","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3488710"},{"title":"Toutânkhamon: le pharaon maudit","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3214310"},{"title":"Self/less","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2140379"},{"title":"Dragonheart 3: The Sorcerer's Curse","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Video)","Drago (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt3829170"},{"title":"Life","year":" 2015/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2948840"},{"title":"Knight of Cups","year":" 2015","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2101383"},{"title":"Night at the Museum 3","year":" 2014","remarks":["Merenkahre (Ahk's Father)"],"imdbid":"tt2692250"},{"title":"Exodus: Gods and Kings","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1528100"},{"title":"Robot Overlords","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2145829"},{"title":"Learning to Drive","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3062976"},{"title":"The Boxtrolls","year":" 2014","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0787474"},{"title":"Stonehearst Asylum","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1772264"},{"title":"Marvel One-Shot: All Hail the King","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt3438640"},{"title":"Jaguar: Rendezvous","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt3587466"},{"title":"War Story","year":" 2014/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2845578"},{"title":"L'Oracle","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2101473"},{"title":"Ender's Game","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1731141"},{"title":"Walking with the Enemy","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1515208"},{"title":"A Common Man","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2104837"},{"title":"A Birder's Guide to Everything","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1582465"},{"title":"Iron Man 3","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1300854"},{"title":"A Therapy","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt2167404"},{"title":"The Dictator","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1645170"},{"title":"Noah","year":" 2012/III","remarks":["Narrator (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1091821"},{"title":"Hugo","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0970179"},{"title":"Fable III","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Video Game)","Sabine (voice, as Sir Ben Kingsley)"],"imdbid":"tt1495761"},{"title":"Aral.
