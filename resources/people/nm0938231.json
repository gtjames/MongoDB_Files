{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"11 May 1928","placeOfBirth":" San Francisco, California, USA","birthName":"Walter Frank Hermann Wolff","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Frank Wolff started his career by acting in several Roger Corman films. However, Wolff had to travel to Europe to be successful. He was finally able to become a well known actor in Italy and Europe with his performance in Salvatore Giuliano (1962) and had roles in many European film productions. Moreover, Wolff became a major star in Spaghetti Westerns. His most famous, but briefest, performances was as Brett McBain, the friendly farmer in Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). He also brought much needed light relief as the sheriff in Sergio Corbucci's The Great Silence (1968). When the time of \"Spaghetti-Westerns\" was ending, Wolff had several roles in Italian crime movies. Other memorable performances were in Duccio Tessari's Giallo La mort remonte à hier soir (1970) or in one of Wolffs last performances as a police commissioner in Fernando Di Leo's Caliber 9 (1972). Sadly, the great actor suffered from depression and killed himself in the Hilton Hotel in Rome in December 1971.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0938231","name":"Frank Wolff","idIMDB":"nm0938231","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"When Women Lost Their Tails","year":" 1972","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0067639"},{"title":"Caliber 9","year":" 1972","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0067429"},{"title":"Nuits d'amour et d'épouvante","year":" 1971","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0067446"},{"title":"Cold Eyes of Fear","year":" 1971","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0067511"},{"title":"The Beloved","year":" 1971","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0065459"},{"title":"Trasplante de un cerebro","year":" 1970","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0066484"},{"title":"When Women Had Tails","year":" 1970","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0066268"},{"title":"The Lickerish Quartet","year":" 1970","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0065981"},{"title":"Le dernier guet-apens","year":" 1970","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0167085"},{"title":"La mort remonte à hier soir","year":" 1970","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0066098"},{"title":"Metello","year":" 1970","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0066075"},{"title":"Besieged","year":" 1969","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0209350"},{"title":"Sept hommes pour Tobrouk","year":" 1969","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0064071"},{"title":"L'amica","year":" 1969","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0064014"},{"title":"Sartana the Gravedigger","year":" 1969","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0065019"},{"title":"Barbagia (La società del malessere)","year":" 1969","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0064069"},{"title":"Carnal Circuit","year":" 1969","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0165285"},{"title":"I dannati della Terra","year":" 1969","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0167869"},{"title":"Eat It","year":" 1968","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0063269"},{"title":"Ecce Homo","year":" 1968","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0062923"},{"title":"Kill Them All and Come Back Alone","year":" 1968","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0062659"},{"title":"The Libertine","year":" 1968","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0064643"},{"title":"Once Upon a Time in the West","year":" 1968","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0064116"},{"title":"The Great Silence","year":" 1968","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0063032"},{"title":"Aujourd'hui ma peau, demain la tienne","year":" 1968","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0063754"},{"title":"Villa Rides","year":" 1968","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0063775"},{"title":"Sequestro di persona","year":" 1968","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0063582"},{"title":"Pas folles, les mignonnes","year":" 1968","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0061586"},{"title":"God Forgives...
