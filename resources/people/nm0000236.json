{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"16 September 1958","placeOfBirth":" Harbor City, California, USA","birthName":"Jennifer Ellen Chan","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"An actress who always attracts audiences' attention, Jennifer Tilly is by turns funny, sexy, compassionate, compelling and often all at once. Her breakthrough movie role tapped into all of those qualities failing singer Blanche \"Monica\" Moran in Steve Kloves' The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989) opposite brothers Jeff Bridges and Beau Bridges. A few years later, Jennifer earned an Academy Award nomination for her portrayal of the aspiring but hopelessly untalented actress Olive Neal in Woody Allen's Bullets Over Broadway (1994). She has become well-known to filmgoers for both major studio and independent films. In Tom Shadyac's blockbuster Liar Liar (1997), she kept pace with Jim Carrey. Her steamy performance opposite Gina Gershon helped make Lana Wachowski's and Lilly Wachowski's Bound (1996) a breakout indie success at the Sundance Film Festival and then in theatrical release. It also expanded Jennifer's already significant gay and lesbian following. She successfully cultivated another fan base with the revitalization of the \"Child's Play\" horror comedy franchise. For Ronny Yu's La fiancée de Chucky (1998), the filmmakers turned to Jennifer to create the character who would spark the series in a new direction. She met the challenge and established a new horror icon in Tiffany. This Halloween, in Rogue Pictures' all-new Le fils de Chucky (2004), written and directed by series creator Don Mancini, Jennifer again takes the popular series to the next level; she stars as Tiffany and as herself, the deadly doll's favorite actress, who soon becomes an unwitting hostess in more ways than one. Jennifer's pitch-perfect voiceover work as Tiffany is not the only instance of her being able to incarnate a character from the vocal chords out. Families know her distinctive cadences from the recent Disney hits Home on the Range (2004) (in which Jennifer voiced a new-age bovine), directed by Will Finn and John Sanford; The Haunted Mansion (2003) (in which Jennifer acted from the neck up only), directed by Rob Minkoff; and the Pixar blockbuster Monsters, Inc. (2001) (voicing Mike's love interest Celia), directed by Pete Docter, David Silverman and Lee Unkrich. She began her acting career as a teenager, putting herself through the theater program at Stephens College in Missouri by winning writing competitions. She then headed to Los Angeles, California. While she continued to act on the stage (earning a Dramalogue Award for her performance in \"Vanities\"), movies and television immediately came calling for the actress with the unique voice and visage. Over the years, Jennifer has made memorable appearances on some of television's best series, including Hill Street Blues (1981) (in a recurring dramatic role), Cheers (1982), Moonlighting (1985), It's Garry Shandling's Show. (1986) and Frasier (1993). In addition, she has been a favored guest on a number of talk shows, from The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962) to The Arsenio Hall Show (1989) to (currently) The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992). Those interview segments have encouraged viewers to expect the unexpected from her interplay with the host and the studio audience. Her many films over a two-decade span include Neil Jordan's High Spirits (1988), Oliver Stone's The Doors (1991), Richard Benjamin's Made in America (1993), Roger Donaldson's The Getaway (1994), Joe Pytka's Let It Ride (1989), P.J. Castellaneta's Relax... It's Just Sex (1998), Michael Radford's Dancing at the Blue Iguana (2000), Peter Bogdanovich's The Cat's Meow (2001) (in which she played Louella Parsons). Jennifer Tilly has also continued to act on the stage. She won a Theater World Award for her performance in off-Broadway's \"One Shoe Off\" and starred on Broadway in the 2001 revival of \"The Women\" (which was later taped for, and broadcast on, PBS).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQxNDI2MzA0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTcxOTI0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000236","name":"Jennifer Tilly","nicknames":["The Unabombshell","Jenny"],"idIMDB":"nm0000236","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Cult of Chucky","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3280262"},{"title":"Ray Meets Helen","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5813010"},{"title":"Family Guy","year":" 1999-2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0182576"},{"title":"A Cinderella Story: If the Shoe Fits","year":" 2016","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt5822648"},{"title":"Spun Out","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2603568"},{"title":"Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Video Game)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt4916238"},{"title":"Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja","year":" 2013-2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2341339"},{"title":"Modern Family","year":" 2011-2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1442437"},{"title":"The Secret Lives of Dorks","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1418757"},{"title":"Return to Babylon","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0255820"},{"title":"Curse of Chucky","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2230358"},{"title":"Amelia's 25th","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1845774"},{"title":"The Simpsons","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096697"},{"title":"30 Beats","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1484521"},{"title":"Drop Dead Diva","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1280822"},{"title":"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0247082"},{"title":"Made in Romania","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0963177"},{"title":"The Making of Plus One","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1251756"},{"title":"The Cleveland Show","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1195935"},{"title":"Empire of Silver","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1362045"},{"title":"An American Girl: Chrissa Stands Strong","year":" 2009","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt1340418"},{"title":"Inconceivable","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0974005"},{"title":"Bart Got a Room","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0472050"},{"title":"The Caretaker","year":" 2008/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0871026"},{"title":"Deal","year":" 2008/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0446676"},{"title":"Intervention","year":" 2007/V","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0462302"},{"title":"The Initiation of Sarah","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0795403"},{"title":"Family Guy","year":" 2006","remarks":["(Video Game)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0847163"},{"title":"Out of Practice","year":" 2005-2006","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0460666"},{"title":"Tideland","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0410764"},{"title":"Oscar, le chien qui vaut des milliards","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0379708"},{"title":"The Civilization of Maxwell Bright","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0299135"},{"title":"Lil' Pimp","year":" 2005","remarks":["(Video)","Miss De La Croix (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0291311"},{"title":"Le fils de Chucky","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0387575"},{"title":"Love on the Side","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0384037"},{"title":"A Dairy Tale","year":" 2004","remarks":["(Video short)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0860903"},{"title":"Saint Ralph","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0384488"},{"title":"El padrino","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0325950"},{"title":"Frasier","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106004"},{"title":"Home on the Range","year":" 2004","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0299172"},{"title":"Perfect Opposites","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0259567"},{"title":"Second Best","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0328390"},{"title":"Happy End","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0332281"},{"title":"The Haunted Mansion","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0338094"},{"title":"Jericho Mansions","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0338159"},{"title":"Hollywood North","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0337640"},{"title":"Monsters, Inc.
