{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"10 March 1984","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Olivia Jane Cockburn","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Actress and activist Olivia Wilde is a modern-day renaissance woman. Starring in films and popular television shows, Wilde shares the screen with renowned actors while simultaneously giving back to the community. Olivia Wilde was born Olivia Jane Cockburn in New York City, to journalists Leslie Cockburn (née Leslie Corkill Redlich) and Andrew Cockburn. Her father is from an upper-class British family and her mother is American-born; her recent ancestry includes English, Scottish, German, Irish, and Manx. Olivia was raised in Washington, D.C., and went to school there, as well as at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, from which she graduated in 2002. Her father was born in England and later became an Irish citizen, giving Olivia dual American and Irish nationality, and facilitating her brief study at the Gaiety School of Acting in Dublin, Ireland. After appearing in the short-lived Fox television series Skin (2003), she made her Hollywood debut in The Girl Next Door (2004) and then came to public notice in The O.C. (2003), but it was as Dr. Remy \"Thirteen\" Hadley in House (2004) that she achieved international stardom. She has since starred or co-starred in the films TRON: Legacy (2010), Cowboys & Aliens (2011), In Time (2011), People Like Us (2012) and The Words (2012). Wilde's 2010s film credits include the star-studded Third Person, the Oscar-winning drama Her and critically-acclaimed and Golden Globe-nominated Rush. Wilde also produced and starred in the indie comedy Drinking Buddies. In 2013, Wilde launched the philanthropic company Conscious Commerce, with the mission to create a guide for conscious living by promoting the causes, brands, people and lifestyles that are forging a new paragon of living. In line with the Conscious Commerce mission, Wilde also recently signed on to be the face of H&M's latest Conscious Exclusive Collection, which is made completely using organic and recycled materials. She is also a board member of Artists For Peace and Justice and sits on the foundation board of the ACLU of Southern California. In 2015, Wilde produced and starred in the drama Meadowland, which premiered at the year's Tribeca Film Festival. Wilde earned rave reviews for her emotionally charged performance as a mother coping with the heartbreak following her young son's disappearance. Up next for Wilde is the holiday comedy Love The Coopers. The film, which features an ensemble cast, follows the exasperated members of an extended family who gather for their annual holiday celebration. Returning to television next year, Wilde will star alongside Bobby Canavale in HBO's Untitled Rock 'N' Roll drama. Set in 1970s New York, the series is being produced by Martin Scorsese, Mick Jagger and Terence Winter. Wilde previously starred in FOX's acclaimed medical drama \"House,\" playing the standout Dr. Thirteen for six seasons.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWJiYmFjZDAtYjYwMi00M2NkLWJlNTgtMzgzZjU0NTBkY2Q4L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzExOTQxNjM@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1312575","name":"Olivia Wilde","idIMDB":"nm1312575","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"A Vigilante","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6211976"},{"title":"Black Dog, Red Dog","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2171791"},{"title":"Son of Zorn","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4798814"},{"title":"Vinyl","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3186130"},{"title":"Love the Coopers","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2279339"},{"title":"BoJack Horseman","year":" 2014-2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3398228"},{"title":"Doll & Em","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2561882"},{"title":"Meadowland","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3529656"},{"title":"Portlandia","year":" 2014-2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1780441"},{"title":"The Lazarus Effect","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2918436"},{"title":"The Longest Week","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2064968"},{"title":"American Dad!","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0397306"},{"title":"Better Living Through Chemistry","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1609479"},{"title":"Her","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1798709"},{"title":"The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2114184"},{"title":"Puzzle","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2343793"},{"title":"Rush","year":" 2013/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1979320"},{"title":"The Incredible Burt Wonderstone","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0790628"},{"title":"Drinking Buddies","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2265398"},{"title":"Robot Chicken","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0437745"},{"title":"TRON: Uprising","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1812523"},{"title":"People Like Us","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1716777"},{"title":"House","year":" 2007-2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0412142"},{"title":"Deadfall","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1667310"},{"title":"The Words","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1840417"},{"title":"Free Hugs","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt2058614"},{"title":"Saturday Night Live","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0072562"},{"title":"On the Inside","year":" 2011/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1260365"},{"title":"In Time","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1637688"},{"title":"Butter","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1349451"},{"title":"The Change-Up","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1488555"},{"title":"Cowboys & Aliens","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0409847"},{"title":"Tron: Evolution - Battle Grids","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Video Game)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2058122"},{"title":"Tron: Evolution","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Video Game)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1572508"},{"title":"TRON: Legacy","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1104001"},{"title":"The Next Three Days","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1458175"},{"title":"Weird: The Al Yankovic Story","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt1630285"},{"title":"The Ballad of G.I.
