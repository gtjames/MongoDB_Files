Robert as a child often looked up to his father as his inspiration and role-model. Carl Reiner was on The Dick Van Dyke Show which Carl Reiner created and also starred in. Estelle Reiner was the inspiration for Rob Reiner to become a director. Robert's mother was a singer, and Robert as a director it helped him understand how music was used in a scene, how the color on a set should be, the acting, and writing, and that was heavily influenced by his mother. Rob Reiner due to his father's success eventually knew he was going to be apart of the industry. Rob Reiner often felt pressured how he would measure up to his father's twelve Emmys and prestigious awards and honor success streak. When Rob Reiner graduated high school, he began to express further interest in show business, his parents advised him to go to Summer Theater. Reiner got a job as an apprentice in the Buck's County Playhouse in Pennsylvania. Reiner then went to be further educated at UCLA Film School.

Rob Reiner directed Oscar-nominated movies such as The Princess Bride, Stand By Me, and This Is Spinal Tap. With these successful box-office movies in 1987, Robert Reiner founded his own production company called, Castle Rock Entertainment.
