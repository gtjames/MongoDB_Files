{"data":{"names":[{"height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Alex Lawther was born in Petersfield, Hampshire, England in 1995. He is mainly known for his role portraying as the young Alan Turing in the film, The Imitation Game (2014). For playing such a role as that, he won the London Film Critics' Circle Award for \"Young British Performer of the Year\" in January of 2015. Being the youngest of three, and the son of two lawyers, he found out quickly that he had to entertain himself. After joining several different drama groups including The National Youth Theatre, young Lawther finally found his big break with a play called South Downs at the age of 16. He also starred alongside Michael Begley and Michelle Collins in the new Hampstead Theatre show, The Glass Supper. In addition, Alex found himself next to Benedict Cumberbatch and Kiera Knightly as the young Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch playing as Alan Turing) in the Oscar-Winning film, The Imitation Game. Not to mention, his role as Isaac Cooper in the film X+Y. Alex Lawther sure did find a way to entertain himself, and he found the best way to do so. He is a brilliant young actor and we will hopefully be seeing more of him in the future to come.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4OTQzNTg4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA2MTU1OTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3867299","name":"Alex Lawther","idIMDB":"nm3867299","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Ghost Stories","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5516328"},{"title":"Freak Show","year":" 2017/II","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5089534"},{"title":"Untitled A.A.
