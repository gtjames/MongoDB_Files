Afterwards, he directed Judi Dench in \"The Cherry Orchard\", for which he won a Critics Circle Award for Best Newcomer. He then joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, where he directed such productions as \"Troilus and Cressida\" with Ralph Fiennes and \"Richard III\". In 1992, he became artistic director of the reopened Donmar Warehouse in London, where he directed such productions as \"The Glass Menagerie\" and the revival of the musical \"Cabaret\", which earned four Tony Awards including one for Best Revival of a Musical.
