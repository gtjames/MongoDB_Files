Salman started his acting carrier in 1988 by doing a supporting role in the movie Biwi Ho To Aisi (1988). The following year he had the leading role in the box office romantic hit Maine Pyar Kiya (1989). From there he became a heart throb of Indian cinema. Following with other box office hits he showed his terrific performance in Saajan (1991), Andaz Apna Apna (1994), Hum Aapke Hain Koun...! (1994), Karan Arjun (1995), Khamoshi: The Musical (1996), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998). His transformations can be sensitive, vulnerable, funny, aggressive and charming as his role demands. In 1998 he was arrested by the local police from the shooting location of the film Hum Saath-Saath Hain: We Stand United (1999), for killing protected wild animals and spent about a week behind the bars. The actor is facing trial in three cases of killing black bucks and Chinkaras and another of illegal possession of arms. In September 2002, Salman Khan had hit the headlines after he crashed his Land Cruiser near the American Express bakery in Bandra, killing one man and injuring others. Being known for those roguish behaviors, he tried to balance his troubled life with his career. In 2003, he gave his emotionally charged performance as playing an obsessed lover in Tere Naam (2003) that translated into good reviews and a good run at the box office. He not only managed to revive his career, but also to restore the confidence of his producers and distributors alike. His work was noticed internationally in the movie Phir Milenge (2004) where he played the role of an AIDS patient. It was well appreciated by the World Health Organization (WHO) for presenting the problems of AIDS patient in today's world. In 2007, he launched Being Human - Salman Khan Foundation. This charitable organization aids the underprivileged in areas such as education and health-care. More recently, he starred in the multiple record breaking box office super-hit Dabangg (2010), Ready (2011) and Bodyguard (2011).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwNTIxODg0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg2NzM0OTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006795","name":"Salman Khan","nicknames":["Sallu","Bhaijan","Dabangg Khan","Blockbuster Khan","Rambo of India","The New King of Bollywood","The Sylvester Stallone of India","Controversial Khan","Tiger Khan","Tiger Salman","The Tiger of Bollywood","Salman Tiger Khan","Muscle Khan","Supreme Khan","Blockbuster Star","Dabangg Star","Kick Star","Wanted Star","Robin Hood Khan","One Man Army"],"idIMDB":"nm0006795","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Tiger Zinda Hai","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5956100"},{"title":"Tubelight","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5882970"},{"title":"Dus","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0338943"},{"title":"No Entry Mein Entry","year":" ","remarks":["Prem (rumored)"],"imdbid":"tt2373236"},{"title":"Sultan","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4832640"},{"title":"Un trésor appelé Amour","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3595298"},{"title":"Bajrangi Bhaijaan","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3863552"},{"title":"C.I.D.","year":" 2009-2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0401916"},{"title":"Kick","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2372222"},{"title":"Lai Bhaari","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3850798"},{"title":"Main Tera Hero","year":" 2014","remarks":["Various God (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2762334"},{"title":"O Teri","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3483596"},{"title":"Jai Ho","year":" 2014/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1188982"},{"title":"Phata Poster Nikhla Hero","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2615584"},{"title":"Saas Bahu Aur Betiyaan","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2563224"},{"title":"Ishkq in Paris","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1986040"},{"title":"Dabangg 2","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2112131"},{"title":"Diya Aur Baati Hum","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2570866"},{"title":"Son of Sardaar","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2178508"},{"title":"Ek Tha Tiger","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2016894"},{"title":"Tell Me O Kkhuda","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1961530"},{"title":"Bodyguard","year":" 2011","remarks":["Lovely B.
