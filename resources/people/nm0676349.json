{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"2 July 1927","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"George Fisher","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Born of African and West Indian ancestry on July 2, 1927 in New York City, Brock Peters set his sights on a show business career early on, at age ten. A product of NYC's famed Music and Arts High School, Peters initially fielded more odd jobs than acting jobs as he worked his way up from Harlem poverty. Landing a stage role in \"Porgy and Bess\" in 1949, he quit physical education studies at CCNY and went on tour with the acclaimed musical. His film debut came in Carmen Jones (1954), but he really began to make a name for himself - having dropped his real name, George Fisher, in 1953 - in such films as To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) and The L-Shaped Room (1962). He received a Tony Award nomination for his starring stint in Broadway's \"Lost in the Stars\" in 1973. He also appeared in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986) and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991), two sequels to the popular Star Trek films. Brock Peters died at age 78 of pancreatic cancer on August 23, 2005.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTM0OTMwMzc1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkwMjEzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0676349","name":"Brock Peters","idIMDB":"nm0676349","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Borg War","year":" 2006","remarks":["(Video)","General Mi'Qoch (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1050237"},{"title":"JAG","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0112022"},{"title":"Static Shock","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0247729"},{"title":"The Locket","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0327016"},{"title":"Star Trek: Starfleet Command III","year":" 2002","remarks":["(Video Game)","General Mi'Qogh (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0339724"},{"title":"The Wild Thornberrys Movie","year":" 2002","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0282120"},{"title":"No Prom for Cindy","year":" 2002","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0294796"},{"title":"10,000 Black Men Named George","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0280377"},{"title":"The Last Place on Earth","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0218390"},{"title":"The Legend of Tarzan","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0283754"},{"title":"Samurai Jack","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Series)","Lazzor (Elder)"],"imdbid":"tt0278238"},{"title":"The Wild Thornberrys","year":" 1998-2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0167743"},{"title":"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine","year":" 1996-1998","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106145"},{"title":"Park Day","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0179409"},{"title":"Two Weeks from Sunday","year":" 1997","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0178957"},{"title":"Spicy City","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0149524"},{"title":"Johnny Bravo","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0118360"},{"title":"The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest","year":" 1996-1997","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115226"},{"title":"Adventures from the Book of Virtues","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0227868"},{"title":"The Pretender","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115320"},{"title":"Ghosts of Mississippi","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0116410"},{"title":"Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0122355"},{"title":"Aaahh!!!
