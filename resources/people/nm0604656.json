One of 11 children of a wealthy manufacturer, Morgan followed his older brother, Ralph Morgan (born Raphael Wuppermann) into the acting profession, making his Broadway debut in 1914 and his film debut two years later. Morgan specialized in playing courtly, sometimes eccentric or befuddled but ultimately sympathetic characters, such as the alcoholic telegraph operator in The Human Comedy (1943) or the shop owner in The Shop Around the Corner (1940). He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for The Affairs of Cellini (1934). Frank Morgan died at age 59 of a heart attack on September 18, 1949 in Beverly Hills, California.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMTc0MzQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI5NTkxNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0604656","name":"Frank
