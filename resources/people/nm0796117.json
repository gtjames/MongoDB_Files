{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"6 August 1970","placeOfBirth":" Mahé, Pondicherry, India","birthName":"Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Born in India but raised in the posh suburban Penn Valley area of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, M. Night Shyamalan is the son of two doctors. His passion for filmmaking began when he was given a Super-8 camera at age eight, and even at that young age began to model his career on that of his idol, Steven Spielberg. His first film, Praying with Anger (1992), was based somewhat on his own trip back to visit the India of his birth. He raised all the funds for this project, in addition to directing, producing and starring in it. Wide Awake (1998), his second film, he wrote and directed, and shot it in the Philadelphia-area Catholic school he once attended--even though his family was of a different religion, they sent him to that school because of its strict discipline.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMTA5OTMxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDA4NDg1Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0796117","name":"M.
