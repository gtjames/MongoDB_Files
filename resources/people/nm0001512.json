(Pagone) and Frank A. Mastrantonio, who ran a bronze foundry. Her parents were of Italian descent. She was raised in Oak Park, IL, and began her career in school plays as a teenager. Mary attended the University of Illinois and got bitten by the acting bug, starring in \"Guys and Dolls\". Leaving for New York, she took part in \"West Side Story\" in 1981. She also made it into movies, starring alongside Al Pacino in Scarface (1983). In 1985, she starred in The Color of Money (1986), which earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Around 1990, a string of movies came about that really gave her a lot of attention: important roles in The Abyss (1989), Class Action (1991), and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991). At this time she married The January Man (1989) director Pat O'Connor. Mastrantonio is also a renowned cabaret-style singer, and her singing is showcased in John Sayles's Limbo (1999). Careerwise, she took the decision to pick roles she liked instead of roles that would attract attention. Also, she took time off to be with her family. As of 2001, she lives with her husband and two children in London, England, UK.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0Mzc5MzIxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODUwNjc1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001512","name":"Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio","idIMDB":"nm0001512","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Limitless","year":" 2015-2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4422836"},{"title":"Amok","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2090494"},{"title":"Grimm","year":" 2012-2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1830617"},{"title":"Hostages","year":" 2013-2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2647258"},{"title":"Blue Bloods","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1595859"},{"title":"Law & Order: Criminal Intent","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0275140"},{"title":"The Russell Girl","year":" 2008","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt1097649"},{"title":"Without a Trace","year":" 2005-2006","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0321021"},{"title":"The Brooke Ellison Story","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0407612"},{"title":"Standing Room Only","year":" 2003","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0185704"},{"title":"Tabloid","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0281253"},{"title":"The Perfect Storm","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0177971"},{"title":"Witness Protection","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0191655"},{"title":"My Life So Far","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0120899"},{"title":"Limbo","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0164085"},{"title":"Three Wishes","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0114663"},{"title":"Frasier","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106004"},{"title":"Two Bits","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0114753"},{"title":"Consenting Adults","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0104006"},{"title":"White Sands","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0105813"},{"title":"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves","year":" 1991","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0102798"},{"title":"Class Action","year":" 1991","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0101590"},{"title":"Performance","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0298685"},{"title":"Fools of Fortune","year":" 1990","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0099594"},{"title":"The Abyss","year":" 1989","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0096754"},{"title":"The January Man","year":" 1989","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0097613"},{"title":"Slam Dance","year":" 1987","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0093986"},{"title":"The Color of Money","year":" 1986","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0090863"},{"title":"Mussolini: The Untold Story","year":" 1985","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0088579"},{"title":"Scarface","year":" 1983","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0086250"},{"title":"The King of Comedy","year":" 1982","remarks":["Extra in crowd scene (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0085794"}]},{"section":"Soundtrack","filmography":[{"title":"Limbo","year":" 1999","remarks":["(performer: \"You Never Can Tell\" a/k/a \"C'est La Vie\", \"Better Off Without You\", \"(Lookin' For)","The Heart of Saturday Night\", \"Dimming of the Day\")"],"imdbid":"tt0164085"},{"title":"The January Man","year":" 1989","remarks":["(performer: \"Auld Lang Syne\", \"Calendar Girl\" -
