{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"16 January 1887","placeOfBirth":" Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, USA","birthName":"John Rummel Hamilton","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"Burly, stentorian-voiced John Hamilton, worked on Broadway and in touring theatrical companies for many years prior to his 1930 film debut. He was in the original Broadway company of \"Seventh Heaven\" and would appear in the film remake (Seventh Heaven (1937)) in 1937. For Warner Bros, he starred with Donald Meek in a series of short mysteries based on S.S. Van Dine stories. He was often typecast as prison wardens, judges and police chiefs, but played various types of characters in an almost limitless number of films from the 1930s to the 1950s. He became famous when he was cast as Daily Planet newspaper editor Perry White in the 1950s TV classic, Adventures of Superman (1952). He is survived by a son. Hamilton is often confused with John F. Hamilton, a British actor who made a few films in the US during the same period, and with several other actors of the same name.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NzY5NjMyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTc5NzUyMjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0357963","name":"John Hamilton","idIMDB":"nm0357963","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Adventures of Superman","year":" 1952-1958","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0044231"},{"title":"Outcasts of the City","year":" 1958","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0052039"},{"title":"Tales of Wells Fargo","year":" 1957","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0050066"},{"title":"Chicago Confidential","year":" 1957","remarks":["Attorney Emory Morgan (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0050249"},{"title":"The Count of Monte Cristo","year":" 1956","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047723"},{"title":"State Trooper","year":" 1956","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0050062"},{"title":"The Roy Rogers Show","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0043225"},{"title":"TV Reader's Digest","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047780"},{"title":"Bobby Ware Is Missing","year":" 1955","remarks":["Stearns - Goodwin's Associate (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0047893"},{"title":"Screen Directors Playhouse","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047768"},{"title":"Tales of the Texas Rangers","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047781"},{"title":"The Night of the Hunter","year":" 1955","remarks":["Townsman Who Greets Rachel (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0048424"},{"title":"Treasury Men in Action","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0042159"},{"title":"The Star and the Story","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047738"},{"title":"Passport to Danger","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0046634"},{"title":"Cavalcade of America","year":" 1953-1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0044248"},{"title":"Your Favorite Story","year":" 1953-1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0045419"},{"title":"The Halls of Ivy","year":" 1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0046606"},{"title":"Sitting Bull","year":" 1954","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0047501"},{"title":"Captain Midnight","year":" 1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0046585"},{"title":"Moby Dick","year":" 1954","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0239652"},{"title":"City Story","year":" 1954","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0180605"},{"title":"The Miami Story","year":" 1954","remarks":["Clifton Staley (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0047232"},{"title":"The Ford Television Theatre","year":" 1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0041024"},{"title":"I Led 3 Lives","year":" 1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0045397"},{"title":"Stamp Day for Superman","year":" 1954","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0046360"},{"title":"With This Ring","year":" 1954","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt3909908"},{"title":"The Studebaker Story","year":" 1953","remarks":["(Short)","Father Studebaker (as John R.
