{"data":{"names":[{"bio":"Jim Gallien was the last person to see Christopher \"Alexander Supertramp\" Johnson McCandless. He gave Chris a ride from Fairbanks, Alaska to the head of Stampede Trail. Jim was concerned about Chris, who had little gear and no experience in the Alaskan wilderness. He tried to persuade Chris to defer his trip and offered to drive him to Anchorage to buy suitable equipment. Eventually, Jim gave Chris a pair of rubber boots, 2 tuna melts, and a bag of corn chips.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2946106","name":"Jim Gallien","idIMDB":"nm2946106","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Into the Wild","year":"Â 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0758758"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.7","serverTime":"2017/01/16 06:16:35"}}
