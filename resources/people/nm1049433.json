He studied physics and philosophy at Trinity College Dublin. While at university he directed short videos with the Trinity Video Society, which he co-founded with Ed Guiney. He graduated in 1991 with first class honours (gold medal). His first short film, 3 Joes, won the Best European Short Film Award at the 1991 Cork Film Festival and the Organiser's Award at the 1992 Oberhausen Short Film Festival. He directed numerous commercials for television in Ireland, the UK and worldwide before taking the helm on his first feature film, Adam & Paul, a stylized downbeat comedy written by Mark O'Halloran and released in 2004. Adam and Paul won the Best First Feature award at the 2004 Galway Film Fleadh and the Grand Prix at the 2005 Sofia International Film Festival. His second feature film, Garage, another collaboration with writer Mark O' Halloran, was selected for Director's Fortnight at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and won the CICAE Art and Essai award. The film also won the awards for Best Film, Best Director, Best Script and Best Actor at the 2008 Irish Film and Television Awards (IFTAs). Lenny has also directed for television: his four one-hour TV films for RTE, Prosperity, also won the Best Director for TV award 2008 Irish Film and Television Awards. What Richard Did, his third feature, was released in 2012 to critical acclaim. The film, written by Malcolm Campbell, presents a stark portrait of a privileged Dublin teen whose world unravels with one summer night. What Richard Did premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival and was also selected for the 2012 BFI London Film Festival. Lenny's fourth feature, Frank, a comedy about a young wannabe musician starring Michael Fassbender and Domhnall Gleeson, will be shooting in Winter 2012.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExMDQyMTQzNjleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDg0NTk5ODAx._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1049433","name":"Lenny Abrahamson","idIMDB":"nm1049433","filmographies":[{"section":"Director","filmography":[{"title":"Chance","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)","(2 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt5620076"},{"title":"Room","year":" 2015/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3170832"},{"title":"Frank","year":" 2014/II","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1605717"},{"title":"What Richard Did","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2092011"},{"title":"Dublin 26.06.08: A Movie in 4 Days","year":" 2008","remarks":["(feature director)"],"imdbid":"tt1450148"},{"title":"Prosperity","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Series)","(4 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt1117550"},{"title":"Garage","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0878674"},{"title":"Adam & Paul","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0419420"},{"title":"3 Joes","year":" 1991","remarks":["(Short)","(as Leonard Abrahamson)"],"imdbid":"tt0283827"}]},{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"Dublin 26.06.08: A Movie in 4 Days","year":" 2008","remarks":["(concept)"],"imdbid":"tt1450148"},{"title":"3 Joes","year":" 1991","remarks":["(Short)","(story - as Leonard Abrahamson)"],"imdbid":"tt0283827"}]},{"section":"Producer","filmography":[{"title":"Chance","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)","(executive producer - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt5620076"},{"title":"The Meaning of Eggsistence","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Short)","(associate producer)"],"imdbid":"tt1866267"}]},{"section":"Editor","filmography":[{"title":"Public Toilet","year":" 1992","remarks":["(Short)","(as Leonard Abrahamson)"],"imdbid":"tt0296816"}]},{"section":"Soundtrack","filmography":[{"title":"Frank","year":" 2014/II","remarks":["(lyrics: \"Tuft\")"],"imdbid":"tt1605717"}]},{"section":"Thanks","filmography":[{"title":"Orna","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Short)","(special thanks)"],"imdbid":"tt4227216"},{"title":"The Crush","year":" 2010/I","remarks":["(Short)","(special thanks)"],"imdbid":"tt1509756"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Making 'Room'","year":" 2016","remarks":["(Video documentary short)"],"imdbid":"tt6010852"},{"title":"La noche de los Oscar","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt5513760"},{"title":"The 88th Annual Academy Awards","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Special)"],"imdbid":"tt4991632"},{"title":"Last Call with Carson Daly","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0305056"},{"title":"The EE British Academy Film Awards","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Special documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt5448304"},{"title":"Tavis Smiley","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0403813"},{"title":"Made in Hollywood","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0911896"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.7","serverTime":"2017/01/16 05:57:46"}}
