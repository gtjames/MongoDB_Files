In the mid-nineties he continued to act in theater productions as well as in several TV dramas, including Moon Over Seoul with Han Seok-gyu. 1997 marked his return to motion pictures, with a role as a tough-talking police investigator in Song Neung-han's No. 3 (1997). His biggest role came in 1999, when he was cast in Korea's most successful film ever, Shiri (1999). His portrayal of a North Korean agent garnered him much praise and a Best Actor Award from the 1999 domestic Grand Bell Awards. After starring in a theater production of Hamlet in spring of 1999, Choi took on the role of a husband who discovers his wife's infidelity in Happy End (1999), and in early 2001 starred as a third-rate gangster opposite Hong Kong actress Cecilia Cheung in the acclaimed Failan (2001). In 2003 he starred in the now classic Old Boy (2003).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwNjExNDMyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTYxODczMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0158856","name":"Min-sik Choi","idIMDB":"nm0158856","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Special Citizen","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6150238"},{"title":"The Tiger: An Old Hunter's Tale","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5066556"},{"title":"The Admiral","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3541262"},{"title":"Lucy","year":" 2014/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2872732"},{"title":"New World","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2625030"},{"title":"Nameless Gangster: Rules of the Time","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2082221"},{"title":"Lili à la découverte du monde sauvage","year":" 2011","remarks":["Wanderer - Nagnae (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1971466"},{"title":"Kiss & Cry","year":" 2011","remarks":["Narrator (Korean version)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt3625930"},{"title":"I Saw the Devil","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1588170"},{"title":"Destination Himalaya","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1179079"},{"title":"Lady Vengeance","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0451094"},{"title":"Crying Fist","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0457007"},{"title":"Springtime","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0420646"},{"title":"Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0386064"},{"title":"Old Boy","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0364569"},{"title":"Painted Fire","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0317234"},{"title":"Failan","year":" 2001","remarks":["(as Min-shik Choi)"],"imdbid":"tt0289181"},{"title":"Happy End","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0220507"},{"title":"Shiri","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0192657"},{"title":"The Quiet Family","year":" 1998","remarks":["Chang-ku Kang (Uncle)"],"imdbid":"tt0188503"},{"title":"No. 3","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0128371"},{"title":"Seoul ui dal","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0141816"},{"title":"Sara Is Guilty","year":" 1993","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0318043"},{"title":"Notre héros défiguré","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0105075"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Lucy: The Evolution of Lucy","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt4525790"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/15 02:17:55"}}
