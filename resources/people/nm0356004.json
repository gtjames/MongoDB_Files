{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"19 September 1888","placeOfBirth":" Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","birthName":"Clifford Porter Hall","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"For over two decades, Porter Hall made a career out of playing villains and pompous, unpleasant people. His movie career was not a mirror of his real life, however. Mr. Hall was well known as a generous and outgoing person who was well-liked by almost everybody he knew. It is ironic that the role he is most often seen in today is that of an atheist in Going My Way (1944) - ironic because Hall was a deacon in his church. Hall, who didn't make his first movie until he was 43, remained active until his death in 1953.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxOTQ4YTktN2YxNS00NjJmLWFlZWItOTBlMjEzZmM3MzdjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUxODE0MDY@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0356004","name":"Porter Hall","idIMDB":"nm0356004","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Return to Treasure Island","year":" 1954","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0047406"},{"title":"Fireside Theatre","year":" 1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0041023"},{"title":"Vice Squad","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0046514"},{"title":"Pony Express","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0046198"},{"title":"Chevron Theatre","year":" 1953","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2380776"},{"title":"Four Star Playhouse","year":" 1952","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0044263"},{"title":"Holiday for Sinners","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0044715"},{"title":"The Half-Breed","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0044681"},{"title":"Carbine Williams","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0044480"},{"title":"Life with Luigi","year":" 1952","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0044274"},{"title":"Ace in the Hole","year":" 1951","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0043338"},{"title":"The Bigelow Theatre","year":" 1950","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0042084"},{"title":"Intruder in the Dust","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041513"},{"title":"The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041165"},{"title":"Chicken Every Sunday","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040229"},{"title":"That Wonderful Urge","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040870"},{"title":"You Gotta Stay Happy","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040982"},{"title":"Unconquered","year":" 1947","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039931"},{"title":"Singapore","year":" 1947","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039829"},{"title":"Miracle on 34th Street","year":" 1947","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039628"},{"title":"Kiss and Tell","year":" 1945","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0037848"},{"title":"Week-End at the Waldorf","year":" 1945","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0038239"},{"title":"Murder, He Says","year":" 1945","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0037931"},{"title":"Blood on the Sun","year":" 1945","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0037547"},{"title":"Bring on the Girls","year":" 1945","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0037560"},{"title":"The Mark of the Whistler","year":" 1944","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0037049"},{"title":"The Great Moment","year":" 1944","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0036880"},{"title":"Going My Way","year":" 1944","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0036872"},{"title":"Double Indemnity","year":" 1944","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0036775"},{"title":"The Miracle of Morgan's Creek","year":" 1944","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0037077"},{"title":"Standing Room Only","year":" 1944","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0037310"},{"title":"The Woman of the Town","year":" 1943","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0037470"},{"title":"The Desperadoes","year":" 1943","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0035798"},{"title":"A Stranger in Town","year":" 1943","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0036395"},{"title":"Butch Minds the Baby","year":" 1942","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0034560"},{"title":"The Remarkable Andrew","year":" 1942","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0035247"},{"title":"Mr. and Mrs. North","year":" 1942","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0033926"},{"title":"Sullivan's Travels","year":" 1941","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0034240"},{"title":"The Parson of Panamint","year":" 1941","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0034004"},{"title":"Trail of the Vigilantes","year":" 1940","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0033180"},{"title":"Arizona","year":" 1940","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0032221"},{"title":"Dark Command","year":" 1940","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0032383"},{"title":"His Girl Friday","year":" 1940","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0032599"},{"title":"Henry Goes Arizona","year":" 1939","remarks":["Banker Edward G.
