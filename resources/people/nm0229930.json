Dobson went on to join the summer stock Royal Shakespeare Company in Monterey CA, and found his way to Los Angeles to began studying with acting coach Sandra Seacat. Within three years of landing in Los Angeles at the age of 21, Dobson landed his first starring role - after being chosen from a nation wide search - in the Tri-Star Pictures musical, \"Sing\", from the producers of \"Fame\" and \"Footloose\". This was followed by the critically acclaimed adaptation of Hubert Selby's \"Last Exit To Brooklyn\", and Neil Simon's \"The Marrying Man\". Director Robert Zemeckis cast Dobson in the title role of the short lived but highly acclaimed comedy TV series CBS's \"Johnny Bago\", which led to starring roles in numerous TV series and TV movies, including Michael Mann's \"Miami Vice\". A fan of Dobson's work, Mann then cast Dobson in the original version of \"HEAT\" in the highly acclaimed \"LA Takedown\". Other notable series include CBS's \"Lenny\", FOX's \"Party of Five\", HBO's \"Tales From The Crypt\" and \"Norma Jean and Marilyn\". He portrayed young Elvis Presley in Academy Award winning \"Forrest Gump\". Following that were Peter Jackson's cult classic \"The Frighteners\", and \"Drowning Mona\". With his growing popularity, Dobson was then offered the title role in the USA Network series \"Cover Me: The True Life of an FBI Family\". Following the series-run of \"Cover Me\", Dobson moved behind the camera. He Wrote and Produced the hilarious Sundance Film Festival favorite, his first film, \"Choose Life\". (A story about two hit men obsessed with the 80's pop group Wham!). He then went on to Produce his first feature \"Double Down\" starring himself and Jason Priestley.

And this has led to his upcoming Feature Film in Development, \"Exit 102: Asbury Park\" & Attaching Oscar nominated Cinematographer Dean Cundey. Most recently, Dobson is Exec.
