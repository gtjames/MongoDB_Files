{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"8 September 1981","placeOfBirth":" Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, USA","birthName":"Jonathan Taylor Weiss","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Jonathan Taylor Thomas was born Jonathan Taylor Weiss on September 8, 1981 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, to Claudine (Gonsalves) and Stephen Weiss. He has an older brother, Joel, and has Pennsylvania Dutch (German) and Portuguese ancestry. Growing up, he liked the music group Boyz II Men, and his favorite TV shows were Roseanne (1988) and Grace Under Fire (1993), but he also liked watching CNN news, to keep up to date with current events. One thing that Jonathan does not like is meat. He has been a vegetarian since he was four years old, and he doesn't use products that are tested on animals because he believes that it is wrong to hurt them. When Jonathan was four years old, his family moved from Bethlehem to Sacramento, California. At the age of seven, Jonathan was working as a model for print advertisements in Sacramento, and over the next few years, he appeared in TV commercials for Kelloggs cereal, Mattel toys and for many other products. By this time, Jonathan was ready for bigger roles, and in 1989, he landed the part of Greg Brady's son Kevin in the TV special The Bradys (1990). In 1990, he landed his biggest role yet, as Randy Taylor on Home Improvement (1991). Jonathan's audition went well, but what really gave him an edge over the other boys was that the casting directors thought that he looked a lot like his TV dad-to-be, Tim Allen. In 1991, Jonathan's parents divorced. He lived with his mother and his brother. He began work in feature length movies, as the voice of young Simba in Disney's The Lion King (1994), and as Ben Archer in Man of the House (1995) opposite Chevy Chase. Among his other movies are Tom and Huck (1995), The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996), Wild America (1997), and I'll Be Home for Christmas (1998).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQwNjc0MTYwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzE3NzQz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001795","name":"Jonathan Taylor Thomas","nicknames":["JTT","Jon"],"idIMDB":"nm0001795","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Last Man Standing","year":" 2013-2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1828327"},{"title":"The Extra","year":" 2006/I","remarks":["(Short)","Director (as Jonathan Thomas)"],"imdbid":"tt0861347"},{"title":"Thru the Moebius Strip","year":" 2005","remarks":["Prince Ragis (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0267024"},{"title":"Tilt-A-Whirl","year":" 2005","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0460962"},{"title":"Veronica Mars","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0412253"},{"title":"8 Simple Rules","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0312081"},{"title":"Smallville","year":" 2002-2004","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0279600"},{"title":"The Simpsons","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096697"},{"title":"An American Town","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0296300"},{"title":"Timothy Tweedle the First Christmas Elf","year":" 2000","remarks":["(TV Movie)","Timothy Tweedle (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0267978"},{"title":"The Tangerine Bear: Home in Time for Christmas!","year":" 2000","remarks":["(Video)","Tangie (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0268677"},{"title":"Ally McBeal","year":" 2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0118254"},{"title":"Common Ground","year":" 2000","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0212889"},{"title":"The Wild Thornberrys","year":" 2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0167743"},{"title":"Walking Across Egypt","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0175317"},{"title":"Speedway Junky","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0155197"},{"title":"Home Improvement","year":" 1991-1998","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0101120"},{"title":"I'll Be Home for Christmas","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0155753"},{"title":"I Woke Up Early the Day I Died","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0125211"},{"title":"Wild America","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0120512"},{"title":"Christmas in Oz","year":" 1996","remarks":["(Video short)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0115893"},{"title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio","year":" 1996","remarks":["(Video Game)"],"imdbid":"tt0346478"},{"title":"The Oz Kids","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115307"},{"title":"Who Stole Santa?","year":" 1996","remarks":["(Video)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0118162"},{"title":"The Nome Prince and the Magic Belt","year":" 1996","remarks":["(Video)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0117200"},{"title":"Toto Lost in New York","year":" 1996","remarks":["(Video)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0117947"},{"title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio","year":" 1996","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0115472"},{"title":"Tom and Huck","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0112302"},{"title":"Man of the House","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0113755"},{"title":"The Lion King Activity Center","year":" 1995","remarks":["(Video Game)"],"imdbid":"tt5666578"},{"title":"Pom Poko","year":" 1994","remarks":["(English version, voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0110008"},{"title":"The Lion King","year":" 1994","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0110357"},{"title":"The Itsy Bitsy Spider","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0108818"},{"title":"In Living Color","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098830"},{"title":"The Bradys","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098756"},{"title":"ABC TGIF","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0312324"},{"title":"The Adventures of Spot","year":" 1987","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0220963"}]},{"section":"Director","filmography":[{"title":"Last Man Standing","year":" 2013-2016","remarks":["(TV Series)","(3 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt1828327"}]},{"section":"Soundtrack","filmography":[{"title":"I'll Be Home for Christmas","year":" 1998","remarks":["(performer: \"I Got Rolled\")"],"imdbid":"tt0155753"},{"title":"Home Improvement","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Series)","(performer -
