His brothers are actors Liam Hemsworth and Luke Hemsworth. He is of Dutch (from his immigrant maternal grandfather), Irish, English, Scottish, and German ancestry. His uncle, by marriage, was Rod Ansell, the bushman who inspired the film Crocodile Dundee (1986). Chris saw quite a bit of the country in his youth, after his family moved to the Northern Territory before finally settling on Phillip Island, to the south of Melbourne. In 2004, he unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of Robbie Hunter in the Australian soap opera Summer Bay (1988) but was recalled for the role of Kim Hyde which he played until 2007. In 2006, he entered the Australian version of Dancing with the Stars (2004) and his popularity in the soap enabled him to hang on until show 7 (Dancing with the Stars: Episode #5.7 (2006) when he became the fifth contestant to be eliminated. His first Hollywood appearance was in Star Trek (2009), but it was his titular role in Thor (2011) which propelled him to prominence worldwide. He reprised the character in the science fiction blockbuster The Avengers (2012). Chris's American representative, management company ROAR, also manages actress Elsa Pataky, and it was through them that the two met, marrying in 2010. The couple have a daughter and twin sons.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTU2MTI0NTIyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA4Nzc3OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1165110","name":"Chris Hemsworth","nicknames":["Kip"],"idIMDB":"nm1165110","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Avengers: Infinity War","year":" 2018","remarks":["(rumored)"],"imdbid":"tt4154756"},{"title":"Thor: Ragnarok","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3501632"},{"title":"Horse Soldiers","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1413492"},{"title":"Untitled Star Trek Sequel","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4756228"},{"title":"Doctor Strange","year":" 2016","remarks":["(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt1211837"},{"title":"Team Thor","year":" 2016","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt6016776"},{"title":"Ghostbusters","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1289401"},{"title":"The Huntsman: Winter's War","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2381991"},{"title":"In the Heart of the Sea","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1390411"},{"title":"Vacation","year":" 2015/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1524930"},{"title":"Avengers: Age of Ultron","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2395427"},{"title":"Blackhat","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2717822"},{"title":"Thor: The Dark World","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1981115"},{"title":"Rush","year":" 2013/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1979320"},{"title":"Star Trek Into Darkness","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1408101"},{"title":"Red Dawn","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1234719"},{"title":"Snow White and the Huntsman","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1735898"},{"title":"The Avengers","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0848228"},{"title":"The Cabin in the Woods","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1259521"},{"title":"Thor: God of Thunder","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Video Game)","Thor (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1699199"},{"title":"Thor","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0800369"},{"title":"Talk About It!","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt2814306"},{"title":"Ollie Klublershturf vs. the Nazis","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1522220"},{"title":"Ca$h","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1106860"},{"title":"A Perfect Getaway","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0971209"},{"title":"Star Trek","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0796366"},{"title":"Summer Bay","year":" 2004-2007","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0094481"},{"title":"Fergus McPhail","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0380893"},{"title":"Grand galop","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0278876"},{"title":"Marshall Law","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0302135"},{"title":"Les voisins","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0088580"},{"title":"Guenièvre Jones","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0316985"}]},{"section":"Thanks","filmography":[{"title":"Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)","(thanks)"],"imdbid":"tt3591568"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Winter's Vistas: The Making of The Huntsman: Winter's War","year":" 2016","remarks":["(Video documentary short)"],"imdbid":"tt6008234"},{"title":"Entertainment Tonight","year":" 2010-2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0081857"},{"title":"Dish Nation","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1973047"},{"title":"The Late Late Show with James Corden","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4280606"},{"title":"Today","year":" 2015-2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0044298"},{"title":"Ellen: The Ellen DeGeneres Show","year":" 2015-2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0379623"},{"title":"Rencontres de cinéma","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt5123584"},{"title":"Jimmy Kimmel Live!","year":" 2011-2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0320037"},{"title":"2016 MTV Movie Awards","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Special)"],"imdbid":"tt5556144"},{"title":"The Graham Norton Show","year":" 2013-2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0924651"},{"title":"Sunrise","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0428169"},{"title":"Chase and Pollard: A Man of Means and a Man of Courage","year":" 2016","remarks":["(Video documentary short)"],"imdbid":"tt5652792"},{"title":"The Hard Life of a Whaler","year":" 2016","remarks":["(Video documentary short)"],"imdbid":"tt5652808"},{"title":"The 24th Annual Movieguide Awards","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Special)"],"imdbid":"tt5440526"},{"title":"Ok!
