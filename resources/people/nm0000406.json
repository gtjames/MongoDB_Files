Asked what brought him to Hollywood, he replied \"The train\". He became one of the most respected directors in the business, in spite of being known for his westerns, which were not considered \"serious\" film. He won six Oscars, counting (he always did) the two that he won for his WWII documentary work. He had one wife; a son and daughter; and a grandson, Dan Ford who wrote a biography on his famous grandfather.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5NDczOTUzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDE3NDkwNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000406","name":"John Ford","nicknames":["Pappy","Coach","Uncle Jack","The Admiral","The Liberal Democrat at Republic","Jack"],"idIMDB":"nm0000406","filmographies":[{"section":"Director","filmography":[{"title":"Chesty: A Tribute to a Legend","year":" 1976","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0065541"},{"title":"7 Women","year":" 1966","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0060050"},{"title":"Young Cassidy","year":" 1965","remarks":["(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0059930"},{"title":"Cheyenne Autumn","year":" 1964","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0057940"},{"title":"Donovan's Reef","year":" 1963","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0057007"},{"title":"How the West Was Won","year":" 1962","remarks":["(segment \"The Civil War\")"],"imdbid":"tt0056085"},{"title":"Alcoa Premiere","year":" 1962","remarks":["(TV Series)","(1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0054513"},{"title":"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance","year":" 1962","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0056217"},{"title":"Two Rode Together","year":" 1961","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0055558"},{"title":"Wagon Train","year":" 1960","remarks":["(TV Series)","(1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0050073"},{"title":"Sergeant Rutledge","year":" 1960","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0054292"},{"title":"Korea","year":" 1959","remarks":["(Documentary short)"],"imdbid":"tt0052974"},{"title":"The Horse Soldiers","year":" 1959","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0052902"},{"title":"The Last Hurrah","year":" 1958","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0051845"},{"title":"Gideon of Scotland Yard","year":" 1958","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0051655"},{"title":"Quand se lève la lune","year":" 1957","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0050902"},{"title":"The Wings of Eagles","year":" 1957","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0051198"},{"title":"The Searchers","year":" 1956","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0049730"},{"title":"Screen Directors Playhouse","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)","(1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0047768"},{"title":"Jane Wyman Presents The Fireside Theatre","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)","(1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0047745"},{"title":"Mister Roberts","year":" 1955","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0048380"},{"title":"The Long Gray Line","year":" 1955","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0048312"},{"title":"Mogambo","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0046085"},{"title":"The Sun Shines Bright","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0046384"},{"title":"What Price Glory","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045323"},{"title":"The Quiet Man","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045061"},{"title":"This Is Korea!","year":" 1951","remarks":["(Documentary)","(as Rear Admiral John Ford USNVR Ret.)"],"imdbid":"tt0044122"},{"title":"Rio Grande","year":" 1950","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0042895"},{"title":"Wagon Master","year":" 1950","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0043117"},{"title":"When Willie Comes Marching Home","year":" 1950","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0043129"},{"title":"Pinky","year":" 1949","remarks":["(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0041746"},{"title":"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041866"},{"title":"Fireside Theatre","year":" 1949","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0041023"},{"title":"3 Godfathers","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040064"},{"title":"Fort Apache","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040369"},{"title":"The Fugitive","year":" 1947","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039402"},{"title":"My Darling Clementine","year":" 1946","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0038762"},{"title":"They Were Expendable","year":" 1945","remarks":["(as John Ford Captain U.S.N.R.)"],"imdbid":"tt0038160"},{"title":"Undercover","year":" 1944","remarks":["(Documentary)","(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt3665116"},{"title":"December 7th: The Movie","year":" 1943","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0035790"},{"title":"German Industrial Manpower","year":" 1943","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0274519"},{"title":"How to Operate Behind Enemy Lines","year":" 1943","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0274560"},{"title":"We Sail at Midnight","year":" 1943","remarks":["(Documentary short)","(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0036517"},{"title":"At the Front in North Africa with the U.S. Army","year":" 1943","remarks":["(Documentary short)","(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt2491546"},{"title":"Torpedo Squadron","year":" 1942","remarks":["(Documentary short)"],"imdbid":"tt0035459"},{"title":"The Battle of Midway","year":" 1942","remarks":["(Short documentary)","(as Lt.
