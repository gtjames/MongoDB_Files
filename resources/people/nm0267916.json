{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"5 June 1878","placeOfBirth":" Boston, Massachusetts, USA","birthName":"William Smith","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Boston-born Franklyn Farnum was on the vaudeville stage at the age of 12 and was featured in a number of theatre and musical productions by the time he entered silent films near the age of 40. He appeared to be at his most comfortable in the saddle, his career dominated mostly by westerns. Some of his more famous films include the serial Vanishing Trails (1920) and features The Clock (1917), The Firebrand (1922), The Drug Store Cowboy (1925) and The Gambling Fool (1925). In 1925 he left films, but returned five years later at the advent of sound, only to find himself billed much further down the credits, if at all. He continued on, however, in these obscure roles well into the 1950s. Largely forgotten today, he is not related to silent actors and brothers Dustin Farnum and William Farnum. One of his three wives was the ill-fated Alma Rubens, to whom he was briefly married in 1918. Farnum passed away from cancer in 1961.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwOTU5Mzg0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzIzNjI1NDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0267916","name":"Franklyn
