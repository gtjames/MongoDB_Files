{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"29 May 1921","placeOfBirth":" Spokane, Washington, USA","birthName":"George Clifton James","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Blustery, stocky, loud although often genial character actor who has created a niche for himself playing often frustrated and fast talking Southern characters... most noticeably as Sheriff J.W. Pepper alongside Roger Moore in the James Bond spy adventure Live and Let Die (1973), plus his character returned to assist 007 again in The Man with the Golden Gun (1974). He may have perfected a Southern drawl, however Clifton James was actually born on May 29, 1921 in Spokane, Washington, a graduate of the Actors Studio and was regularly appearing in guest roles on 1950s-60s television series including Gunsmoke (1955), Bonanza (1959) and The Virginian (1962). He was also busy in the cinema with minor roles in classy productions, such as Cool Hand Luke (1967), Will Penny (1967) and The New Centurions (1972). After his 007 escapades, James remained busy putting in a great dramatic performance in The Deadly Tower (1975), played another loud-mouthed Sheriff in the action comedy Silver Streak (1976) and was superb as team owner Charles Comiskey in the dramatization of the 1919 Chicago White Sox scandal, Eight Men Out (1988). He has been quieter in recent years, but recently showed he could still contribute an enjoyable performance in the wonderful John Sayles movie Sunshine State (2002).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NzA1MTU4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg2NDk0NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0416378","name":"Clifton
