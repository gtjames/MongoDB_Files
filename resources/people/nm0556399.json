{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"22 February 1921","placeOfBirth":" San Giorgio di Piano, Emilia-Romagna, Italy","birthName":"Giulia Anna Masina","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"Born in San Giorgio di Piano, Giulietta Masina spent part of her teenage years living with a widowed aunt in Rome, where she cultivated a passion for the theater and studied for a degree in Philosophy. She began her career on the radio with the program \"Terzoglio\" (1942), about the adventures of newlyweds Cico and Pallina from scripts written by Federico Fellini. The series brought her great success. The following year she married Fellini and became the inspirational muse for many of his films. She made her cinema debut in Sans pitié (1948), directed by Alberto Lattuada, but really established her reputation with her next few films: Behind Closed Shutters (1951), directed by Luigi Comencini, Variety Lights (1951), which also marked Fellini's debut as director (the film credits both Fellini and Lattuada); and Europe '51 (1952), directed by Roberto Rossellini. Her artistic partnership with her husband really took off with the Oscar-winning La Strada (1954), followed by Il Bidone (1955) and the widely acclaimed The Nights of Cabiria (1957), which again won an Oscar and brought her the award for Best Female Performance at the Cannes Film Festival. Over the following years she played many memorable roles in such films as Fortunella (1958), directed by Eduardo De Filippo; ...and the Wild Wild Women (1959), directed by Renato Castellani; and later in Juliet of the Spirits (1965) and Ginger and Fred (1986), both directed by Fellini. From 1966 to 1969 she hosted the immensely popular radio show \"Lettere aperte a Giulietta Masina\" and starred in the television series Eleonora (1973), by Tullio Pinelli, directed by Silverio Blasi, and Camilla (1976), directed by Sandro Bolchi, based on the novel by Fausta Cialente, \"Un inverno freddissimo\" (1966). She died in Rome in 1994, just a few months after the death of her husband.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjcxODk2Nzg4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjgxMTU2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0556399","name":"Giulietta Masina","idIMDB":"nm0556399","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Aujourd'hui peut-être...","year":" 1991","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0101382"},{"title":"Ginger and Fred","year":" 1986","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0091113"},{"title":"Sogni e bisogni","year":" 1985","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0090040"},{"title":"The Feather Fairy","year":" 1985","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0089800"},{"title":"Camilla","year":" 1976","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0074275"},{"title":"Eleonora","year":" 1973","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0070024"},{"title":"The Madwoman of Chaillot","year":" 1969","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0064621"},{"title":"Non stuzzicate la zanzara","year":" 1967","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0062050"},{"title":"Scusi, lei è favorevole o contrario?","year":" 1966","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0062242"},{"title":"Juliet of the Spirits","year":" 1965","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0059229"},{"title":"La grande vie","year":" 1960","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0054007"},{"title":"Jons und Erdme","year":" 1959","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0052947"},{"title":"...and the Wild Wild Women","year":" 1959","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0051986"},{"title":"Fortunella","year":" 1958","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0050406"},{"title":"The Nights of Cabiria","year":" 1957","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0050783"},{"title":"Il Bidone","year":" 1955","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0047876"},{"title":"Buonanotte... avvocato!","year":" 1955","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0047906"},{"title":"L'assassin de la rue Paradis","year":" 1954","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0047653"},{"title":"La Strada","year":" 1954","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0047528"},{"title":"Un siècle d'amour","year":" 1954","remarks":["The Neighbour at the Rear Window (segment \"Purificazione\")"],"imdbid":"tt0046842"},{"title":"Angels of Darkness","year":" 1954","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045698"},{"title":"Dans les faubourgs de la ville","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0044338"},{"title":"Il romanzo della mia vita","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045101"},{"title":"Europe '51","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0043511"},{"title":"The White Sheik","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0044000"},{"title":"Wanda la pécheresse","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045311"},{"title":"Position Wanted","year":" 1951","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0043373"},{"title":"Sette ore di guai","year":" 1951","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0044024"},{"title":"Behind Closed Shutters","year":" 1951","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0042842"},{"title":"Variety Lights","year":" 1951","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0042692"},{"title":"Sans pitié","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040773"},{"title":"Paisan","year":" 1946","remarks":["The young woman on the palace stairs (episode IV: Firenze)","(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0038823"}]},{"section":"Thanks","filmography":[{"title":"Somebody to Love","year":" 1994","remarks":["(in memory of -
