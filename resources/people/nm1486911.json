He grew up in a family of six and was the oldest child. He earned his high school diploma in Biology. Once a psychology student at the University of Tehran, he dropped out with the intent of emigrating to Canada. Instead, he ended up as a radio host in Iran. This was followed by hosting \"Oxygen,\" a TV show for the youth audience, and some small acting roles in a few TV series of which \"After Rain\" (Pas Az Baran) was the first. His debut in cinema was in Rokhsareh (2002), performing alongside Mitra Hajjar. His acting career took off with his performance in movies such as Tahmineh Milani's The Fifth Reaction (2003) (Vakonesh-e-Panjom) and Superstar (2009). He won the Crystal Simorgh from Tehran's 27th Fajr International Film Festival for his performance as Kourosh in \"Superstar\". Two years later, he received the Diploma of Honor from Fajr Film Festival and the Silver Bear Award from the prestigious Berlin International Film Festival for his memorable role as the hot-tempered Hodjat in Asghar Farhadi's internationally critically acclaimed film, A Separation (2011). He has also received several nominations and awards from Iran's House of Cinema including Best Actor in a Lead Role for his performance in Asghar Fardadi's previous film, À propos d'Elly (2009).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3NTY1MjQ1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODUxNzk4Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1486911","name":"Shahab
