He is best known for his Mad Max franchise, with The Road Warrior (1981) and Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) being hailed as amongst the greatest action films of all time. Aside from the Mad Max films, Miller has been involved in a wide range of projects. These include the Academy Award-winning Babe, le cochon devenu berger (1995) and Happy Feet (2006) film series. Miller is co-founder of the production houses Kennedy Miller Mitchell, formerly known as Kennedy Miller, and Dr. D Studios. His younger brother Bill Miller and Doug Mitchell have been producers on almost all the films in Miller's later career, since the death of his original producing partner Byron Kennedy. In 2006, Miller won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature for Happy Feet (2006). He has been nominated for five other Academy Awards: Best Original Screenplay in 1992 for Lorenzo's Oil (1992), Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay in 1995 for Babe, le cochon devenu berger (1995), and Best Picture and Best Director for Mad Max: Fury Road (2015).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTYwMjcyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDQ0MjQz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004306","name":"George Miller","idIMDB":"nm0004306","filmographies":[{"section":"Producer","filmography":[{"title":"Mad Max: The Wasteland","year":" ","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt4575512"},{"title":"Mad Max: Fury Road","year":" 2015","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt1392190"},{"title":"Forgotten Wars, Forgotten Victims","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Video documentary short)","(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt3219196"},{"title":"Happy Feet 2","year":" 2011","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt1402488"},{"title":"Happy Feet","year":" 2006","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0366548"},{"title":"Babe, le cochon dans la ville","year":" 1998","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0120595"},{"title":"100 ans de cinéma: 100 ans de cinéma australien -
