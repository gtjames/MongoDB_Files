{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"13 December 1967","placeOfBirth":" Terrell, Texas, USA","birthName":"Eric Marlon Bishop","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Jamie Foxx is an American actor, singer, and comedian. He won an Academy Award for Best Actor, BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, for his work in the 2004 biographical film Ray (2004). The same year, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the action film Collateral (2004). Other prominent acting roles include the title role in the film Django Unchained (2012), the super villain Electro in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014), and William Stacks in the 2014 version of Annie (2014). Jamie Foxx was born Eric Marlon Bishop in Terrell, Texas, to Louise Annette Talley and Darrell Bishop, who worked as a stockbroker and had later changed his name to Shahid Abdula. His mother was an adopted child. When her marriage to his father failed, his maternal grandparents, Mark and Estelle Talley, stepped in and, at age seven months, adopted Jamie too. He has said that he had a very rigid upbringing that placed him in the Boy Scouts and the church choir. During high school, he played quarterback for his high school team and was good enough that he got press in Dallas newspapers. He studied music in college. He released a music album in 1994, \"Peep This\", and sings the theme song for his 1999 movie, Any Given Sunday (1999). However, in 1989, his life changed when a girl friend challenged him to get up onstage at the Comedy Club. In fact, he says he took his androgynous stage name because he learned that women got preference for mike time on open stage nights. That led to his being cast in Roc (1991) and In Living Color (1990). Foxx had his own WB television show from 1996 to 2001, the sitcom The Jamie Foxx Show (1996), in which he played Jamie King Jr. Foxx is also a Grammy Award-winning musician, producing four albums which have charted highly on the US Billboard 200: Unpredictable (2005), which topped the chart, Intuition (2008), Best Night of My Life (2010), and Hollywood: A Story of a Dozen Roses (2015). In 2012, Foxx starred in the title role of the Quentin Tarantino written and directed Django Unchained. Foxx starred alongside his Ray co-star Kerry Washington, as well as Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. In 2013, Foxx was cast as President James Sawyer in White House Down alongside Channing Tatum. The following year, Foxx appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 as the villain Electro, and co-starred with Quvenzhané Wallis in Annie, Sony's Will Smith and Jay-Z produced update of the comic strip-turned-musical. He has two children, including Corinne Foxx, born in 1995, who lives with her mother.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjY1NDg3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjA2MTg0MzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004937","name":"Jamie Foxx","idIMDB":"nm0004937","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Robin Hood","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4532826"},{"title":"Baby Driver","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3890160"},{"title":"White Famous","year":" ","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt5774044"},{"title":"Sleepless","year":" 2017/III","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2072233"},{"title":"Annie","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1823664"},{"title":"Horrible Bosses 2","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2170439"},{"title":"A Million Ways to Die in the West","year":" 2014","remarks":["(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt2557490"},{"title":"The Amazing Spider-Man 2","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1872181"},{"title":"Rio 2","year":" 2014","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2357291"},{"title":"Pharrell Williams: Happy","year":" 2013","remarks":["(Video short)","Dancer (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt3539462"},{"title":"White House Down","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2334879"},{"title":"Django Unchained","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1853728"},{"title":"Horrible Bosses","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1499658"},{"title":"Rio","year":" 2011","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1436562"},{"title":"Due Date","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1231583"},{"title":"I'm Still Here","year":" 2010/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1356864"},{"title":"Malice N Wonderland","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt1594971"},{"title":"Valentine's Day","year":" 2010/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0817230"},{"title":"Law Abiding Citizen","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1197624"},{"title":"The Soloist","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0821642"},{"title":"The Kingdom","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0431197"},{"title":"Dreamgirls","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0443489"},{"title":"Miami Vice","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0430357"},{"title":"Jarhead","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0418763"},{"title":"Stealth","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0382992"},{"title":"Ray","year":" 2004/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0350258"},{"title":"Collateral","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0369339"},{"title":"Breakin' All the Rules","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0349169"},{"title":"Chappelle's Show","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0353049"},{"title":"Redemption: The Stan Tookie Williams Story","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0388367"},{"title":"Shade","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0323939"},{"title":"Ali","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0248667"},{"title":"Date from Hell","year":" 2001","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0293077"},{"title":"The Jamie Foxx Show","year":" 1996-2001","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115221"},{"title":"Piégé","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0211938"},{"title":"Any Given Sunday","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0146838"},{"title":"Held Up","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0165831"},{"title":"The Players Club","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0119905"},{"title":"Booty Call","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0118750"},{"title":"The Great White Hype","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0116448"},{"title":"The Truth About Cats & Dogs","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0117979"},{"title":"Moesha","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115275"},{"title":"Hangin' with Mr. Cooper","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0103435"},{"title":"C-Bear and Jamal","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0115795"},{"title":"In Living Color","year":" 1991-1994","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098830"},{"title":"Roc","year":" 1992-1993","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0101184"},{"title":"Toys","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0105629"}]},{"section":"Producer","filmography":[{"title":"All-Star Weekend","year":" ","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt2461172"},{"title":"White Famous","year":" ","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt5774044"},{"title":"Apollo Live","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)","(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt2563680"},{"title":"Nite Tales: The Series","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Series)","(executive producer -
