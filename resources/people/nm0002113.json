Sydney left home at age 18 to make his fortune as a Ceylon tea planter, but drought forced him out of business and back to England. He managed a brewery and, to escape boredom, took acting lessons. His stage debut was as a murderer in a 1902 production of \"Sherlock Holmes\". From then on he appeared in numerous plays in England and the US, working through most of the 1930s with Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne at the Theatre Guild. His parts ranged from musical comedy to Shakespeare. His film debut, occurring when he was 62 years old and weighing nearly 300 pounds, was as Kasper Guttman in the classic The Maltese Falcon (1941), with Humphrey Bogart and Peter Lorre. He teamed with Lorre in eight more movies after that. In eight years he made 24 films, all while beset by diabetes and Bright's disease. In 1949 he retired from films, and died four years later. He was 75.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTU1MDc1NTc4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTA5NDYwOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002113","name":"Sydney Greenstreet","idIMDB":"nm0002113","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Malaya","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041622"},{"title":"It's a Great Feeling","year":" 1949","remarks":["Sydney Greenstreet (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0041515"},{"title":"Flamingo Road","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041373"},{"title":"The Velvet Touch","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040934"},{"title":"The Woman in White","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040974"},{"title":"Ruthless","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040751"},{"title":"The Hucksters","year":" 1947","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039477"},{"title":"That Way with Women","year":" 1947","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039893"},{"title":"The Verdict","year":" 1946","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039080"},{"title":"Devotion","year":" 1946","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0038474"},{"title":"Three Strangers","year":" 1946","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039029"},{"title":"Christmas in Connecticut","year":" 1945","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0037595"},{"title":"Conflict","year":" 1945","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0037611"},{"title":"Pillow to Post","year":" 1945","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0037990"},{"title":"Hollywood Canteen","year":" 1944","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0036922"},{"title":"The Conspirators","year":" 1944","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0036719"},{"title":"The Mask of Dimitrios","year":" 1944","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0037055"},{"title":"Between Two Worlds","year":" 1944","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0036641"},{"title":"Passage to Marseille","year":" 1944","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0037166"},{"title":"Background to Danger","year":" 1943","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0035659"},{"title":"Casablanca","year":" 1942","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0034583"},{"title":"Across the Pacific","year":" 1942","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0034428"},{"title":"They Died with Their Boots On","year":" 1941","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0034277"},{"title":"The Maltese Falcon","year":" 1941","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0033870"}]},{"section":"Soundtrack","filmography":[{"title":"The Hucksters","year":" 1947","remarks":["(performer: \"Over There\" - uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0039477"},{"title":"That Way with Women","year":" 1947","remarks":["(performer: \"Who Threw the Overalls in Mrs. Murphy's Chowder?\" - uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0039893"}]},{"section":"Archive footage","filmography":[{"title":"Biography","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0092322"},{"title":"John Huston: The Man, the Movies, the Maverick","year":" 1988","remarks":["(Documentary)","Himself (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0095408"},{"title":"Hollywood: The Great Stars","year":" 1963","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)","Actor 'The Maltese Falcon' (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0853119"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/15 01:01:05"}}
