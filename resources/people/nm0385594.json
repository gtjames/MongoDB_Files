{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"4 April 1875","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York, USA","birthName":"Samuel Southey Hinds","bio":"Samuel S. Hinds, a Harvard graduate, was a lawyer in Hollywood until the stock market crash of 1929, in which he lost most of his money. Hinds, who had an interest in theater acting, decided to embark on a career in acting, albeit it age 54. The tall, dignified-looking Hinds appeared in over 200 films, often cast as kindly authoritarian figures--doctors, judges, military officers, politicians, and such. His two most notable appearances were in Destry Rides Again (1939) and It's a Wonderful Life (1946). In addition to his film work, he kept busy appearing on stage, and continued working up until his death in 1948.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjE2NTQ4MDQtZWZiZi00MzJhLWJiMDAtZGI1NmQ4NmIwZjc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0385594","name":"Samuel S.
