{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"3 February 1925","placeOfBirth":" Platteville, Wisconsin, USA","birthName":"John Donald Fiedler","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Typical of busy character actors, Fiedler made his face (and voice) recognizable to millions. Many know the bald-pated Fiedler as therapy patient \"Mr. Peterson\" on The Bob Newhart Show (1972); others might first recognize him for the 1968 movie, The Odd Couple (1968), and spin-off TV show, The Odd Couple (1970), or perhaps even from the Broadway play that preceded them. Even kids would know that helium-high voice from animated Disney features like Robin Hood (1973), The Fox and the Hound (1981) and the \"Winnie the Pooh\" stories, in which he voiced \"Piglet\". The son of an Irish-German beer salesman, Fiedler knew he wanted to be an actor from his childhood days, when he had a full head of reddish-yellow hair. He made his first professional appearances onstage, branched out into live TV in New York and, then, during the 20 years he lived in Hollywood (1960-80), he turned up in many movies and an ever greater number of popular TV shows.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1Njg3NDg1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY2MTYxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0275835","name":"John Fiedler","idIMDB":"nm0275835","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Kronk's New Groove","year":" 2005","remarks":["(Video)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0401398"},{"title":"Pooh's Heffalump Halloween Movie","year":" 2005","remarks":["(Video)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0457437"},{"title":"Pooh's Heffalump Movie","year":" 2005","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0407121"},{"title":"Winnie the Pooh's Rumbly Tumbly Adventure","year":" 2005","remarks":["(Video Game)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt5608356"},{"title":"Winnie the Pooh: Springtime with Roo","year":" 2004","remarks":["(Video)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0384696"},{"title":"Winnie the Pooh: 123s","year":" 2004","remarks":["(Video short)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2503234"},{"title":"Piglet's Big Movie","year":" 2003","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0323642"},{"title":"House of Mouse","year":" 2001-2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0272388"},{"title":"Winnie the Pooh: A Very Merry Pooh Year","year":" 2002","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0324572"},{"title":"The Book of Pooh","year":" 1999-2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0274240"},{"title":"Kingdom Hearts","year":" 2002","remarks":["(Video Game)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0322968"},{"title":"Mickey's House of Villains","year":" 2001","remarks":["(Video)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0329374"},{"title":"The Book of Pooh: Stories from the Heart","year":" 2001","remarks":["(Video)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt3068426"},{"title":"The Emperor's New Groove","year":" 2000","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0120917"},{"title":"The Tigger Movie","year":" 2000","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0220099"},{"title":"Winnie the Pooh Friendship: Pooh Wishes","year":" 1999","remarks":["(Video short)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0324570"},{"title":"Winnie the Pooh: A Valentine for You","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0267118"},{"title":"Cosby","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115144"},{"title":"A Winnie the Pooh Thanksgiving","year":" 1998","remarks":["(Video short)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0302039"},{"title":"George & Leo","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0118323"},{"title":"Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin","year":" 1997","remarks":["(Video)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0119918"},{"title":"Boo to You Too!
