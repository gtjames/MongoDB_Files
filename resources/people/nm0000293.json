{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"17 April 1959","placeOfBirth":" Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England, UK","birthName":"Shaun Mark Bean","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"Sean Bean's 20 year career spans theater, radio, television and movies. Bean was born in Handsworth, Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, to Rita (Tuckwood) and Brian Bean. He worked for his father's welding firm before he decided to become an actor. He attended RADA in London and appeared in a number of West End stage productions including RSC's \"Fair Maid of the West\" (Spencer), (1986) and \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1987) (Romeo) , as well as \"Deathwatch\" (Lederer) (1985) at the Young Vic and \"Killing the Cat\" (Danny) (1990) at the Theatre Upstairs. This soulful, green-eyed blonde's roles are so varied that his magnetic persona convincing plays angst-ridden villains, as in Clarissa (1991), passionate lovers like Mellors in Lady Chatterley (1993), rough-and-ready soldiers such as Richard Sharpe, heartwrenching warriors as the emotionally torn Boromir in \"The Lord of the Rings,\" and noble Greeks, like Odysseus in Troy (2004), where his very presence in the film adds grace and validity to the rest of the movie. Recently, he did a turn in Shakespeare's \"Macbeth,\" where as the principal lead, he so transfixed the audience that the show was extended in London and critically acclaimed. Bean, however, remains himself, a man's man, and in the glizty world of movies this is a rare thing indeed. Bean resides in London where he enjoys raising his beautiful daughters, his beloved football, and the occasional pint. Bean has three daughters, Lorna, Molly and Evie.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMzc4MDk5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg3MjUxNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000293","name":"Sean
