After taking runner-up in the NJ Golden Gloves, the 1992 Olympics was the next goal. That's when fate stepped in; at his first audition, for Gladiator (1992), he was given a co-starring role! Since then he has branched off into numerous television and film roles. He has garnered critical acclaim for his roles in such films as I Like It Like That (1994), The Sunchaser (1996), Selena (1997), Undisputed (2002), and in television for his roles in Homicide: Life on the Street (1993), UC: Undercover (2001), Third Watch (1999), Oz (1997) and most recently his lead role as Marine Sgt. John \"Manila\" Basilone in HBO's award-winning mini series The Pacific (2010).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODI1MTA2MjkxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTcwMDg2Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0781218","name":"Jon
