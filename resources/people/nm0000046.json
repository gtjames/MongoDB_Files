{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"5 November 1913","placeOfBirth":" Darjeeling, West Bengal, British India [now India]","birthName":"Vivian Mary Hartley","height":"5' 3½\" (1.61 m)","bio":"If a film were made of the life of Vivien Leigh, it would open in India just before World War I, where a successful British businessman could live like a prince. In the mountains above Calcutta, a little princess is born. Because of the outbreak of World War I, she is six years old the first time her parents take her to England. Her mother thinks she should have a proper English upbringing and insists on leaving her in a convent school - even though Vivien is two years younger than any of the other girls at the school. The only comfort for the lonely child is a cat that was in the courtyard of the school that the nuns let her take up to her dormitory. Her first and best friend at the school is an eight-year-old girl, Maureen O'Sullivan who has been transplanted from Ireland. In the bleakness of a convent school, the two girls can recreate in their imaginations the places they have left and places where they would some day like to travel. After Vivien has been at the school for 18 months, her mother comes again from India and takes her to a play in London. In the next six months Vivien will insist on seeing the same play 16 times. In India the British community entertained themselves at amateur theatricals and Vivien's father was a leading man. Pupils at the English convent school are eager to perform in school plays. It's an all-girls school, so some of the girls have to play the male roles. The male roles are so much more adventurous. Vivien's favorite actor is Leslie Howard, and at 19 she marries an English barrister who looks very much like him. The year is 1932. Vivien's best friend from that convent school has gone to California, where she's making movies. Vivien has an opportunity to play a small role in an English film, Things Are Looking Up (1935). She has only one line but the camera keeps returning to her face. The London stage is more exciting than the movies being filmed in England, and the most thrilling actor on that stage is Laurence Olivier. At a party Vivien finds out about a stage role, \"The Green Sash\", where the only requirement is that the leading lady be beautiful. The play has a very brief run, but now she is a real actress. An English film is going to be made about Elizabeth I. Laurence gets the role of a young favorite of the queen who is sent to Spain. Vivien gets a much smaller role as a lady-in-waiting of the queen who is in love with Laurence's character. In real life, both fall in love while making this film, Fire Over England (1937). In 1938, Hollywood wants Laurence to play Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights (1939). Vivien, who has just recently read Gone with the Wind (1939), thinks that the role of Scarlett O'Hara is the first role for an actress that would be really exciting to bring to the screen. She sails to America for a brief vacation. In New York she gets on a plane for the first time to rush to California to see Laurence. They have dinner with Myron Selznick the night that his brother, David O. Selznick, is burning Atlanta on a backlot of MGM (actually they are burning old sets that go back to the early days of silent films to make room to recreate an Atlanta of the 1860s). Vivien is 26 when Gone with the Wind (1939) makes a sweep of the Oscars in 1939. So let's show 26-year-old Vivien walking up to the stage to accept her Oscar and then as the Oscar is presented the camera focuses on Vivien's face and through the magic of digitally altering images, the 26-year-old face merges into the face of Vivien at age 38 getting her second Best Actress Oscar for portraying Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951). She wouldn't have returned to America to make that film had not Laurence been going over there to do a film, Carrie (1952) based on Theodore Dreiser's novel \"Sister Carrie\". Laurence tells their friends that his motive for going to Hollywood to make films is to get enough money to produce his own plays for the London stage. He even has his own theater there, the St. James. Now Sir Laurence, with a seat in the British House of Lords, is accompanied by Vivien the day the Lords are debating about whether the St James should be torn down. Breaking protocol, Vivien speaks up and is escorted from the House of Lords. The publicity helps raise the funds to save the St. James. Throughout their two-decade marriage Laurence and Vivien were acting together on the stage in London and New York. Vivien was no longer Lady Olivier when she performed her last major film role, The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone (1961).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2NTkwMTQ5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDExNjI2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000046","name":"Vivien Leigh","nicknames":["Vivling"],"idIMDB":"nm0000046","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Ship of Fools","year":" 1965","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0059712"},{"title":"The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone","year":" 1961","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0055382"},{"title":"ITV Play of the Week","year":" 1959","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0914702"},{"title":"The Deep Blue Sea","year":" 1955","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0047978"},{"title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","year":" 1951","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0044081"},{"title":"Anna Karenina","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040098"},{"title":"Caesar and Cleopatra","year":" 1945","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0038390"},{"title":"That Hamilton Woman","year":" 1941","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0034272"},{"title":"Waterloo Bridge","year":" 1940","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0033238"},{"title":"21 Days Together","year":" 1940","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0032179"},{"title":"Gone with the Wind","year":" 1939","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0031381"},{"title":"Sidewalks of London","year":" 1938","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0030746"},{"title":"A Yank at Oxford","year":" 1938","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0030989"},{"title":"Storm in a Teacup","year":" 1937","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0029611"},{"title":"Dark Journey","year":" 1937","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0028767"},{"title":"Fire Over England","year":" 1937","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0028872"},{"title":"Gentlemen's Agreement","year":" 1935","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0026402"},{"title":"Things Are Looking Up","year":" 1935","remarks":["Schoolgirl (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0027090"},{"title":"Look Up and Laugh","year":" 1935","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0026647"},{"title":"The Village Squire","year":" 1935","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0027175"}]},{"section":"Soundtrack","filmography":[{"title":"Teresa the Thief","year":" 1973","remarks":["(performer: \"Auld Lang Syne\" - uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0069361"},{"title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","year":" 1951","remarks":["(performer: \"It's Only a Paper Moon\" (1933)","- uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0044081"},{"title":"Waterloo Bridge","year":" 1940","remarks":["(performer: \"It's a Long, Long Way to Tipperary\" (1912)",", \"Candlelight Waltz\" (1940)",", \"Auld Lang Syne\" - uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0033238"},{"title":"Gone with the Wind","year":" 1939","remarks":["(performer: \"Ben Bolt (Oh Don't You Remember)","\" (1848)","- uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0031381"},{"title":"Fire Over England","year":" 1937","remarks":["(performer: \"The Spanish Lady's Love\" (ncredited)",")"],"imdbid":"tt0028872"}]},{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"Round the Film Studios","year":" 1937","remarks":["(TV Series)","(narrative script - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt4916600"}]},{"section":"Thanks","filmography":[{"title":"Dieter & Andreas","year":" 1989","remarks":["(Short)","(grateful acknowledgment)"],"imdbid":"tt1836778"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"The Ed Sullivan Show","year":" 1963","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0040053"},{"title":"The 17th Annual Tony Awards","year":" 1963","remarks":["(TV Special)"],"imdbid":"tt0466631"},{"title":"The Jack Paar Tonight Show","year":" 1960","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0050030"},{"title":"Today","year":" 1960","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0044298"},{"title":"The 14th Annual Tony Awards","year":" 1960","remarks":["(TV Special)"],"imdbid":"tt2100636"},{"title":"Small World","year":" 1958","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1645570"},{"title":"Korda Interviews","year":" 1956","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0848353"},{"title":"Cavalcade of the Academy Awards","year":" 1940","remarks":["(Documentary short)"],"imdbid":"tt2271241"},{"title":"Round the Film Studios","year":" 1937","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4916600"}]},{"section":"Archive footage","filmography":[{"title":"Leslie Howard: The Man Who Gave a Damn","year":" 2016","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt2033298"},{"title":"The Drunken Peasants","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4823212"},{"title":"Love, Hate & Propaganda: The Cold War","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt2261797"},{"title":"My Week with Marilyn: The Untold Story of an American Icon","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Video documentary short)","Herself (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt5563304"},{"title":"20 to 1","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0800968"},{"title":"Der Klang Hollywoods - Max Steiner & seine Erben","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt1546652"},{"title":"To Oz!
