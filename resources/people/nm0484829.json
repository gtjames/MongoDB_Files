She was 20 when she made her stage debut at the Playhouse in Chicago as the young countess in \"The Highwayman\". Soon she was on Broadway. In 1950 she went to London for \"Larger Than Life\", a dramatization of W. Somerset Maugham's novel, \"Theatre\". There she received an award for the best performance of the year. The following year in London she had the prima donna role (a singing part) in \"And So To Bed\". In 1954, she published her autobiography, \"You Won't Be So Pretty\". Then in the mid-1950s her film career took off after she was Grace Kelly's mother in To Catch a Thief (1955) and Cary Grant's mother in North by Northwest (1959). Although she claimed to have been born the same year as Grant, she was actually more than seven years older.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMDQ2MjIwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg1ODExOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0484829","name":"Jessie Royce Landis","idIMDB":"nm0484829","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Columbo","year":" 1971","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1466074"},{"title":"Mr. and Mrs. Bo Jo Jones","year":" 1971","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0067449"},{"title":"Ironside","year":" 1969-1971","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0061266"},{"title":"NET Playhouse","year":" 1970","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0439384"},{"title":"Airport","year":" 1970","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0065377"},{"title":"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.","year":" 1965","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0057765"},{"title":"Gidget Goes to Rome","year":" 1963","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0057100"},{"title":"Critic's Choice","year":" 1963","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0056964"},{"title":"Boys' Night Out","year":" 1962","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0055809"},{"title":"Bon Voyage!","year":" 1962","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0055807"},{"title":"Aimez-vous Brahms?","year":" 1961","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0054936"},{"title":"Adventures in Paradise","year":" 1961","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0052440"},{"title":"Thriller","year":" 1960","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0053546"},{"title":"The United States Steel Hour","year":" 1954-1960","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0045449"},{"title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents","year":" 1960","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047708"},{"title":"Art Carney Special","year":" 1960","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1199576"},{"title":"A Private's Affair","year":" 1959","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0053192"},{"title":"North by Northwest","year":" 1959","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0053125"},{"title":"I Married a Woman","year":" 1958","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0051757"},{"title":"My Man Godfrey","year":" 1957","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0050738"},{"title":"The Girl He Left Behind","year":" 1956","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0049264"},{"title":"Goodyear Playhouse","year":" 1953-1956","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0043204"},{"title":"The Swan","year":" 1956","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0049815"},{"title":"Climax!","year":" 1956","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0046587"},{"title":"To Catch a Thief","year":" 1955","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0048728"},{"title":"Armstrong Circle Theatre","year":" 1953-1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0042074"},{"title":"Kraft Theatre","year":" 1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0039123"},{"title":"Main Street to Broadway","year":" 1953","remarks":["Jessie Royce Landis - First Nighter (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0046027"},{"title":"The Gulf Playhouse","year":" 1953","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0381759"},{"title":"Tonight at 8:30","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045243"},{"title":"Larger Than Life","year":" 1952","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt1744620"},{"title":"BBC Sunday-Night Theatre","year":" 1951","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0989125"},{"title":"Mother Didn't Tell Me","year":" 1950","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0042749"},{"title":"My Foolish Heart","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041672"},{"title":"Actor's Studio","year":" 1949","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0040021"},{"title":"It Happens Every Spring","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041514"},{"title":"Mr. Belvedere Goes to College","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041662"},{"title":"The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre","year":" 1948","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0040036"},{"title":"Derelict","year":" 1930","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0020819"},{"title":"At Your Service","year":" 1930","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0764988"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Here's Hollywood","year":" 1962","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0353065"},{"title":"A Night with the Stars","year":" 1950","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1686765"}]},{"section":"Archive footage","filmography":[{"title":"Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color","year":" 1970","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0046593"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/15 04:22:27"}}
