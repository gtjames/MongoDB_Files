{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"24 February 1928","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","bio":"Menacing looking Italian American actor who developed into the quintessential on-screen hoodlum via several strong roles in key crime films of the early 1970s. Lettieri played the villain against some of Hollywood's biggest screen names including chasing Steve McQueen in The Getaway (1972), intimidating Charles Bronson in Mr. Majestyk (1974), threatening 'John Wayne' in McQ (1974) and, arguably in his most well known role, as Virgil \"The Turk\" Sollozo trying to eliminate Marlon Brando in The Godfather (1972). He was already 36 years old when he made his on screen debut in The Hanged Man (1964), and remarkably several years later was associate producer on the disturbing kidnapping drama The Night of the Following Day (1968) starring Marlon Brando. He really hit his strides in the early 1970s starring in many high profile films, before unfortunately succumbing to a heart attack at just 47 years of age. One of the most convincing \"heavies\" of modern cinema.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0NDI4MzIwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjgwMDM1NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0504803","name":"Al Lettieri","idIMDB":"nm0504803","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"The Godfather: A Novel for Television","year":" 1977","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0809488"},{"title":"La cage aux minets","year":" 1976","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0158508"},{"title":"The Hired Gun","year":" 1975","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0075377"},{"title":"Flatfoot in Hong Kong","year":" 1975","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0073541"},{"title":"Mr. Majestyk","year":" 1974","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0071866"},{"title":"McQ","year":" 1974","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0071824"},{"title":"The Deadly Trackers","year":" 1973","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0069951"},{"title":"The Don Is Dead","year":" 1973","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0069989"},{"title":"The Getaway","year":" 1972","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0068638"},{"title":"Footsteps","year":" 1972","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0068602"},{"title":"Pulp","year":" 1972","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0069134"},{"title":"The Godfather","year":" 1972","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0068646"},{"title":"A Town Called Hell","year":" 1971","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0067870"},{"title":"The Night of the Following Day","year":" 1968","remarks":["Pilot (as Al Lettier)"],"imdbid":"tt0064728"},{"title":"The Bobo","year":" 1967","remarks":["Eugenio Gomez (as Alfredo Lettieri)"],"imdbid":"tt0061414"},{"title":"Gunsmoke","year":" 1965","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047736"},{"title":"Dark Intruder","year":" 1965","remarks":["The 2nd Sergeant (as Anthony Lettier)"],"imdbid":"tt0059083"},{"title":"Wild Seed","year":" 1965","remarks":["Bartender (as Anthony Lettier)"],"imdbid":"tt0059912"},{"title":"The Hanged Man","year":" 1964","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0058179"},{"title":"The Lieutenant","year":" 1963","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0056771"},{"title":"The Joey Bishop Show","year":" 1963","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0054552"},{"title":"The Gallant Men","year":" 1963","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0055675"},{"title":"The Untouchables","year":" 1960","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0052522"},{"title":"Not for Hire","year":" 1960","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0052497"},{"title":"The Lawless Years","year":" 1959","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0052484"},{"title":"The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin","year":" 1959","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0046576"},{"title":"The Walter Winchell File","year":" 1958","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0050074"},{"title":"Perry Mason","year":" 1958","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0050051"},{"title":"The Adventures of McGraw","year":" 1957","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0050038"},{"title":"The Sheriff of Cochise","year":" 1957","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0159207"},{"title":"Official Detective","year":" 1957","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0050047"}]},{"section":"Miscellaneous Crew","filmography":[{"title":"The Walking Stick","year":" 1970","remarks":["(dialogue coach - as Alfredo Lettieri)"],"imdbid":"tt0066543"},{"title":"Where Eagles Dare","year":" 1968","remarks":["(dialogue coach - as Alfredo Lettieri)"],"imdbid":"tt0065207"},{"title":"Duffy","year":" 1968","remarks":["(dialogue coach)"],"imdbid":"tt0062917"},{"title":"The Bobo","year":" 1967","remarks":["(dialogue director - as Alfredo Lettieri)"],"imdbid":"tt0061414"},{"title":"Kaleidoscope","year":" 1966","remarks":["(dialogue coach - as Al Lettier)"],"imdbid":"tt0060581"}]},{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"Villain","year":" 1971","remarks":["(adaptation)"],"imdbid":"tt0067952"}]},{"section":"Producer","filmography":[{"title":"The Night of the Following Day","year":" 1968","remarks":["(associate producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0064728"}]},{"section":"Thanks","filmography":[{"title":"La cage aux minets","year":" 1976","remarks":["(dedicatee - as Dediacato ad Al Lettieri)"],"imdbid":"tt0158508"}]},{"section":"Archive footage","filmography":[{"title":"Pupi Avati, ieri, oggi, domani","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1663667"},{"title":"The Godfather","year":" 2006","remarks":["(Video Game)","(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0442674"},{"title":"Gordon Willis on Cinematography","year":" 2001","remarks":["(Video documentary short)","(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt1113795"},{"title":"The Godfather Trilogy: 1901-1980","year":" 1992","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt0150742"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/15 04:30:19"}}
