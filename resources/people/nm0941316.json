{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"14 April 1967","placeOfBirth":" Hamilton, Ontario, Canada","birthName":"James Woolvett","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Jaimz Woolvett studied acting and drama at university and was invited to join the National Theatre School. Jaimz had his first break when he was cast in the sitcom Dog House as the lead and was nominated for a Young Artists Award. Jaimz's big break then followed a few years later when he was cast in the role of 'The Schofield Kid' opposite Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman in the Academy Award winning Unforgiven. Once the film wrapped, Jaimz immediately headed off to Hollywood, a decision that proved a little pre-emptive. Even with a film like Unforgiven to his name, it had not yet been released and wouldn't be for another year, he found himself struggling to find work and when the chance for the lead in a TV show came up, he set off to New Zealand to star in White Fang. As a result, Jaimz was out of the country when the calls did start to come in off of Unforgiven. It was released to critical acclaim and won the Academy Award for Best Film and Director. Upon his return, Jaimz was featured in a number of films including Dead Presidents directed by Albert and Alan Hughes; Rosewood directed by John Singleton; The Guilty, Boogie Boy, Helter Skelter and Hard Time, the latter earning him a Gemini nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role. Woolvett continues. He has started encouraging writers, singers, actors and poets to present their works at 'Open Mike Write' evenings as well as directing and volunteering at numerous schools in the LA area for students of all ages.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3NjkxNTYxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODA5MjAz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0941316","name":"Jaimz
