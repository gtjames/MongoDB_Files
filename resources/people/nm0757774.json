{"data":{"names":[{"bio":"Angel Salazar (born March 2, 1956) is a Cuban-American comedian and actor. This manic,human laugh factory is rather difficult to describe. His Cuban heritage and penchant for sporting mini-skirts notwithstanding, Salazar's performance is a mixture of street-smart ethnic wisecracks, risqué humor, physical comedy, and audience involvement. He disappeared from films in 1993 for a decade!? Only appearing in a documentary called \"Comedian\"(2002) in between. He reappeared in 2003 in the films, \"Harlem Blues\"and \"Vote for Me\". He once again disappeared for 2 yrs from film!?. In 2005, he came back for a film called \"Rose Woes and Joe's \" But then he once again vanished for 2 more years!? In between he did another documentary in 2006 \"The Latin Legends of Comedy\" with J.J. Ramirez and Joey Vega.He reappeared in 2007 with \"Made in Brooklyn \" then again gone for 2 more years!? He again appeared in 2009 and made one short film,'Trust Me'. Then the very next year 2010 he did another short film, 'Crumble' with his co-star from \"Scarface\"(1983), Steven Bauer. He came back to films in 2011 with \"The Last Gamble \"as a character named 'Angel' no-less.
