{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"7 July 1890","placeOfBirth":" Owensboro, Kentucky, USA","bio":"After attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, Kentucky-born Tom Powers signed with Vitagraph Pictures at 21 years of age, in 1911. He stayed there for two years, then shortly thereafter traveled to England, appearing there in both stage productions and films. When he returned to the US he made a few more pictures, but stopped making movies in 1917 and concentrated exclusively on stage work. He didn't appear onscreen again until 1944, when he acceded to Billy Wilder's request to play Mr. Dietrichson, Barbara Stanwyck's doomed husband, in Double Indemnity (1944). He made up for lost time over the next 12 years, appearing in dozens of pictures--often as a detective, army officer, District Attorney or other authority figure--until 1955, when he died of heart failure in November of that year (his last film, The Go-Getter (1956), was released after his death).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg1MjMwOGQtODNkZS00NmRkLTkzZTYtMTc4MTUxZjM4Y2E2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0694631","name":"Tom Powers","idIMDB":"nm0694631","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"The Christophers","year":" 1957","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0408379"},{"title":"Panic!","year":" 1957","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0050049"},{"title":"The Go-Getter","year":" 1956","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0049269"},{"title":"Cavalcade of America","year":" 1956","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0044248"},{"title":"The 20th Century-Fox Hour","year":" 1956","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047702"},{"title":"Four Star Playhouse","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0044263"},{"title":"Big Town","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0042083"},{"title":"Double Jeopardy","year":" 1955","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0046927"},{"title":"Climax!","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0046587"},{"title":"The Eternal Sea","year":" 1955","remarks":["General (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0048047"},{"title":"Lux Video Theatre","year":" 1953-1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0042123"},{"title":"Fireside Theatre","year":" 1951-1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0041023"},{"title":"New York Confidential","year":" 1955","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0048421"},{"title":"Ten Wanted Men","year":" 1955","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0048703"},{"title":"The Americano","year":" 1955","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0047820"},{"title":"The Halls of Ivy","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0046606"},{"title":"General Electric Theater","year":" 1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0045395"},{"title":"The Mad Magician","year":" 1954","remarks":["Inspector (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0047200"},{"title":"The Lone Wolf","year":" 1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047751"},{"title":"Lucky Me","year":" 1954","remarks":["Thayer Crony (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0047194"},{"title":"Adventures of Superman","year":" 1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0044231"},{"title":"Mayor of the Town","year":" 1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0046622"},{"title":"The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet","year":" 1953","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0044230"},{"title":"Sea of Lost Ships","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0046287"},{"title":"Donovan's Brain","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045699"},{"title":"I, the Jury","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045902"},{"title":"Devil's Canyon","year":" 1953","remarks":["Joe Holbert (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0045684"},{"title":"The Last Posse","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045986"},{"title":"Hannah Lee: An American Primitive","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0046153"},{"title":"Julius Caesar","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045943"},{"title":"Scared Stiff","year":" 1953","remarks":["Police Lieutenant (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0046280"},{"title":"The Marksman","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0046047"},{"title":"Hollywood Opening Night","year":" 1953","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0043206"},{"title":"Your Jeweler's Showcase","year":" 1952","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0131192"},{"title":"The Steel Trap","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045190"},{"title":"Horizons West","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0044722"},{"title":"The WAC from Walla Walla","year":" 1952","remarks":["General (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0045303"},{"title":"We're Not Married!","year":" 1952","remarks":["Atty.
