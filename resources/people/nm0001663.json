In addition to co-creating and starring in the critically-acclaimed NBC series, Mad About You (1992), which garnered him Emmy, Golden Globe, American Comedy Award and Screen Actors Guild nominations for Best Actor in a Comedy Series, his successes also include his book, \"Couplehood\", which sold over two million copies and reached the number one spot on \"The New York Times\" best-seller list, and \"Babyhood\", his follow-up book, which features his trademark humorous take on the adventures of being a first-time father, which also made \"The New York Times\" best-seller list. Last year, Paul made his theatrical debut in Woody Allen's \"Writer's Block\". The evening of one-act comedies marked Mr. Allen's first time out as a director for the stage. Born and raised in New York City, Reiser went to college at the State University of New York at Binghamton, where he majored in Music - Piano and Composition. (He co-wrote \"The Final Frontier\" - the theme song from Mad About You (1992), with Grammy-winning producer Don Was). Remembered for notable performances in films, such as Diner (1982), Bye Bye Love (1995), The Marrying Man (1991), Aliens (1986), One Night at McCool's (2001) and Beverly Hills Cop (1984) and Beverly Hills Cop II (1987). More recently, he starred in two original movies for Showtime - Strange Relations (2001) (aka \"Strange Relations\"), opposite Julie Walters, and Chazz Palminteri's Women vs. Men (2002), opposite Joe Mantegna and Christine Lahti.
