He was educated at Cambridge University where he wrote some poetry and was published in a collection 'Contemporaries and Their Maker', along with the spy Donald Maclean. Hamer's cinematic career began as a clapper boy at London Films in 1934, and by 1938 he was on the editing staff. He worked as an editor on Alfred Hitchcock's Jamaica Inn (1939) and worked briefly for the GPO Film Unit. He joined Ealing in 1941 as an editor, becoming an associate producer in 1943. He first made a name for himself as a director with the \"The Haunted Mirror\" segment in the 1945 omnibus film Dead of Night (1945). At Ealing he directed one of the classic British comedies, Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), in which Alec Guinness played eight roles. Hamer was nominated for the Golden Lion at the 1949 Venice Film Festival for his work on the film, as he was in 1954 for directing Guinness in The Detective (1954), which was based on G.K. Chesterton's short stories (Hamer also also directed Guinness in the 1955 romantic comedy To Paris with Love (1955) at Rank and the thriller The Scapegoat (1959), which was based on the Daphne Du Maurier novel, for Du Maurier-Guimness/MGM). Hamer's last directorial effort was 1960's _School for Scoundrels or How to Win Without Actually Cheating! (1960)_ with 'Terry Thomas' and Alastair Sim. He died in London on December 4, 1963, and was buried at Llandegley.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0357607","name":"Robert Hamer","idIMDB":"nm0357607","filmographies":[{"section":"Director","filmography":[{"title":"School for Scoundrels","year":" 1960","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0054279"},{"title":"The Scapegoat","year":" 1959","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0053247"},{"title":"ITV Play of the Week","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)","(2 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt0914702"},{"title":"To Paris with Love","year":" 1955","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0048730"},{"title":"The Detective","year":" 1954","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0046970"},{"title":"The Long Memory","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0044849"},{"title":"His Excellency","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0044711"},{"title":"The Spider and the Fly","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041911"},{"title":"Kind Hearts and Coronets","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041546"},{"title":"It Always Rains on Sunday","year":" 1947","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040481"},{"title":"The Loves of Joanna Godden","year":" 1947","remarks":["(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0039587"},{"title":"Pink String and Sealing Wax","year":" 1945","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0037991"},{"title":"Dead of Night","year":" 1945","remarks":["(segment \"The Haunted Mirror\")"],"imdbid":"tt0037635"},{"title":"San Demetrio London","year":" 1943","remarks":["(completed film, uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0039797"}]},{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"They All Died Laughing","year":" 1964","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0058248"},{"title":"55 Days at Peking","year":" 1963","remarks":["(additional dialogue)"],"imdbid":"tt0056800"},{"title":"The Scapegoat","year":" 1959","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0053247"},{"title":"Rowlandson's England","year":" 1955","remarks":["(Documentary short)"],"imdbid":"tt0048568"},{"title":"ITV Play of the Week","year":" ","remarks":["(TV Series)","(adaptation - 1 episode, 1955)","(adapted by - 1 episode, 1955)"],"imdbid":"tt0914702"},{"title":"The Detective","year":" 1954","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0046970"},{"title":"The Long Memory","year":" 1953","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0044849"},{"title":"His Excellency","year":" 1952","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0044711"},{"title":"Kind Hearts and Coronets","year":" 1949","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0041546"},{"title":"It Always Rains on Sunday","year":" 1947","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0040481"},{"title":"Pink String and Sealing Wax","year":" 1945","remarks":["(script contribution)"],"imdbid":"tt0037991"},{"title":"San Demetrio London","year":" 1943","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0039797"}]},{"section":"Editor","filmography":[{"title":"The Foreman Went to France","year":" 1942","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0033621"},{"title":"Ships with Wings","year":" 1942","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0035322"},{"title":"Turned Out Nice Again","year":" 1941","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0034318"},{"title":"French Communique","year":" 1940","remarks":["(Documentary short)"],"imdbid":"tt5961530"},{"title":"Jamaica Inn","year":" 1939","remarks":["(film editor)"],"imdbid":"tt0031505"},{"title":"Sidewalks of London","year":" 1938","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0030746"},{"title":"The Beachcomber","year":" 1938","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0030933"}]},{"section":"Producer","filmography":[{"title":"While Nero Fiddled","year":" 1944","remarks":["(associate producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0036820"},{"title":"San Demetrio London","year":" 1943","remarks":["(associate producer)"],"imdbid":"tt0039797"},{"title":"My Learned Friend","year":" 1943","remarks":["(associate producer - uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0036184"}]},{"section":"Music department","filmography":[{"title":"While Nero Fiddled","year":" 1944","remarks":["(lyrics)"],"imdbid":"tt0036820"}]},{"section":"Soundtrack","filmography":[{"title":"While Nero Fiddled","year":" 1944","remarks":["(lyrics: \"Caesar's Wife\", \"I'm a Fool About Love\", \"You Never Can Tell\" - uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0036820"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/15 03:23:11"}}
