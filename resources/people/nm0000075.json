{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"5 April 1900","placeOfBirth":" Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","birthName":"Spencer Bonaventure Tracy","height":"5' 9½\" (1.77 m)","bio":"Spencer Tracy was born four years after his brother Carroll to truck salesman John Edward and Caroline Brown Tracy. He attended Marquette Academy along with Pat O'Brien and the two left school to enlist in the Navy at the start of World War I. He was still at Norfolk Navy Yard in Virginia at the end of the war. At Ripon College he did well in the lead of \"The Truth\" and decided on acting as a career. In New York he roomed with O'Brien while they attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts. In 1923 they both got nonspeaking parts as robots in \"R.U.R\". In stock he supported himself with jobs as bellhop, janitor and salesman. John Ford saw his critically acclaimed performance in the lead role in the play \"The Last Mile\" and signed him to Up the River (1930) for Fox. Despite appearing in 16 films there over the next 5 years, Tracy never achieved star status there (during his stint the studio had floundered and was absorbed into Darryl F. Zanuck's 20th Century Pictures). In 1935 he signed with MGM under the aegis of Irving Thalberg and his career flourished. He became the first actor to win back-to-back Oscars for Captains Courageous (1937) and in a project he initially didn't want to star in, Boys Town (1938). He was nominated for San Francisco (1936), Father of the Bride (1950), Bad Day at Black Rock (1955), The Old Man and the Sea (1958), Inherit the Wind (1960), Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967). He had a brief romantic relationship with Loretta Young in the 1930s and a lifelong one with Katharine Hepburn beginning in 1942. His Catholic beliefs precluded ever divorcing his wife Louise, though they lived apart. Tracy suffered from severe alcoholism and diabetes (from the late 1940's), which unfortunately impacted his willingness to accept several tailor-made roles in films that would become big hits. Although his drinking problems were well known, he was inarguably considered one of the best actors in Hollywood among his peers (he had a well deserved reputation for keeping co-stars on their toes for his oddly endearing scene-stealing tricks) and remained in demand. A few weeks after completion of Stanley Kramer's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967), during which he suffered from lung congestion, he died of a heart attack.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwNjE5NTc0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDU5ODI2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000075","name":"Spencer Tracy","nicknames":["Spence","Pops"],"idIMDB":"nm0000075","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner","year":" 1967","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0061735"},{"title":"It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World","year":" 1963","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0057193"},{"title":"How the West Was Won","year":" 1962","remarks":["Narrated by (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0056085"},{"title":"Judgment at Nuremberg","year":" 1961","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0055031"},{"title":"The Devil at 4 O'Clock","year":" 1961","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0054805"},{"title":"Inherit the Wind","year":" 1960","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0053946"},{"title":"The Last Hurrah","year":" 1958","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0051845"},{"title":"The Old Man and the Sea","year":" 1958","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0052027"},{"title":"Desk Set","year":" 1957","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0050307"},{"title":"The Mountain","year":" 1956","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0049523"},{"title":"Bad Day at Black Rock","year":" 1955","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0047849"},{"title":"Broken Lance","year":" 1954","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0046808"},{"title":"The Actress","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045471"},{"title":"Plymouth Adventure","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045039"},{"title":"Pat and Mike","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045012"},{"title":"The People Against O'Hara","year":" 1951","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0043914"},{"title":"Father's Little Dividend","year":" 1951","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0043526"},{"title":"Father of the Bride","year":" 1950","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0042451"},{"title":"Malaya","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041622"},{"title":"Adam's Rib","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041090"},{"title":"Edward, My Son","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041329"},{"title":"State of the Union","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040834"},{"title":"Cass Timberlane","year":" 1947","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039250"},{"title":"The Sea of Grass","year":" 1947","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039806"},{"title":"Without Love","year":" 1945","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0038256"},{"title":"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo","year":" 1944","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0037366"},{"title":"The Seventh Cross","year":" 1944","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0037263"},{"title":"A Guy Named Joe","year":" 1943","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0035959"},{"title":"Keeper of the Flame","year":" 1942","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0034936"},{"title":"Tortilla Flat","year":" 1942","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0035460"},{"title":"Woman of the Year","year":" 1942","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0035567"},{"title":"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde","year":" 1941","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0033553"},{"title":"Men of Boys Town","year":" 1941","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0033902"},{"title":"Boom Town","year":" 1940","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0032273"},{"title":"Edison, the Man","year":" 1940","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0032432"},{"title":"Northwest Passage","year":" 1940","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0032851"},{"title":"Young Tom Edison","year":" 1940","remarks":["Man Admiring Portrait of Thomas A.
