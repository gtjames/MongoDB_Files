After participating in several years of anti Vietnam War protests, he began to establish himself in off-Broadway theater. An incredibly versatile actor, David has played everything from a military general to a yuppie in a coffee shop. To every role that he plays, he brings a spark and a great deal of intelligence. He got his first film role in 1973 in The Paper Chase (1973) and followed up with Bound for Glory (1976), Coming Home (1978), and Being There (1979). In his movies, he has worked with Jack Lemmon, Sissy Spacek, Meryl Streep, and Susan Sarandon. He made the leap to TV in 1977 in the CBS series \"Rafferty\" and followed up with Park Place (1980). He is most famous for his role as Miles Dentrel on the acclaimed drama Thirtysomething (1987). David can now be seen on the CBS series The Agency (2001) playing the computer and forgery expert Joshua Nankin.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxNTU4OTExMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzU1ODI4ODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0166359","name":"David Clennon","idIMDB":"nm0166359","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Dr. Del","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt4515790"},{"title":"Welcome to the Men's Group","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3179350"},{"title":"The Player","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4474310"},{"title":"Reversion","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4578084"},{"title":"Vacation","year":" 2015/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1524930"},{"title":"Amigo Undead","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3281506"},{"title":"Gone Girl","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2267998"},{"title":"Criminal Minds","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0452046"},{"title":"Farmed and Dangerous","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2852872"},{"title":"House of Cards","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1856010"},{"title":"Mr. Jones","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2507280"},{"title":"The Sleepy Man","year":" 2013","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt2317259"},{"title":"The Mentalist","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1196946"},{"title":"J.
