{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"27 August 1943","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Susan Ker Weld","height":"5' 3½\" (1.61 m)","bio":"Susan Ker Weld was born on August 27, 1943, in New York City. When her father, Lathrop Motley Weld, died three years later at the age of 49, the cute little girl, whose name by then had somehow been transmogrified into \"Tuesday\", took over the role of the family breadwinner, which included her mother Yosene Balfour Ker. She became a successful child model, posing for advertisements and mail-order catalogs. Her work and the burden of responsibility estranged her from her mother Yosene, her two elder siblings, and forced the preteen girl into adulthood. At nine years of age, she suffered a nervous breakdown; at ten, she started heavy drinking; one year later, she began having relationships with older men, all of which led to a suicide attempt at age twelve. In 1956 she debuted in the low-budget exploitation movie Rock Rock Rock! (1956) and decided to become an actress. After numerous TV appearances in New York she went to Hollywood in 1958 and was cast for Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys! (1958), something of a breakthrough for her. Over the next few years Tuesday became Hollywood's queen of teen, playing mainly precocious sex kittens. Her wild private life added to the entertainment of her fans. Critics acknowledged her talent, directors approved of her professionalism, and in the late 1960s she even managed to grow out of her child/woman image and find more demanding roles - she had been \"sweet little 16\" for about 16 years. However, Tuesday Weld didn't achieve first-magnitude stardom. Maybe she was just unlucky with her selection of jobs (she turned down Lolita (1962), Bonnie and Clyde (1967), True Grit (1969), Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1969), among others); maybe her independence-loving mind made her instinctively shrink back from the restraints of super stardom. In any case, she kept on performing well in films that had either not much flair or not much success. From the mid-'70s on she focused more and more on made-for-TV movies, which was ironic in that the best (Il était une fois en Amérique (1984)) and the most successful (Chute libre (1993)) films that came her way happened after her big-screen career had pretty much petered out.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4NjI4MzEyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDUwNjI2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001839","name":"Tuesday Weld","idIMDB":"nm0001839","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Chelsea Walls","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0226935"},{"title":"Intimate Affairs","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0243991"},{"title":"Feeling Minnesota","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0116289"},{"title":"Chute libre","year":" 1993","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0106856"},{"title":"Mistress of Suspense","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098889"},{"title":"Heartbreak Hotel","year":" 1988","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0095288"},{"title":"Something in Common","year":" 1986","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0091984"},{"title":"Circle of Violence: A Family Drama","year":" 1986","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0090846"},{"title":"Scorned and Swindled","year":" 1984","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0088065"},{"title":"Il était une fois en Amérique","year":" 1984","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0087843"},{"title":"The Winter of Our Discontent","year":" 1983","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0086592"},{"title":"The Rainmaker","year":" 1982","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0084568"},{"title":"Author!
