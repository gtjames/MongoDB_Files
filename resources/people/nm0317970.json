He developed a drawn-out, explosive sneezing routine that became his trademark (he was the model for, and voice of, Sneezy in Blanche Neige et les sept nains (1937)). Gilbert's exquisite comic timing made him the perfect foil for such comedians as Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, and he was especially memorable as the dim-witted process server Pettibone in His Girl
