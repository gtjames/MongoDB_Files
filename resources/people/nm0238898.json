{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"13 May 1907","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","bio":"Daphne Du Maurier was one of the most popular English writers of the 20th Century, when middle-brow genre fiction was accorded a higher level of respect in a more broadly literate age. For her services to literature, she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1969, the female equivalent of a knighthood. Thus, she achieved a trifecta of sorts, as her father and her husband were both knights. She was born on May 13, 1907 in London, the second daughter of the famous actor-manager Gerald du Maurier, who himself was knighted in 1922, and the actress Muriel Beaumont. Her grandfather was the famous anglo-French writer George L. Du Maurier, the creator of Svengali in his 1894 novel \"Trilby\". (She was also cousin to the Llewelyn Davies boys, through her grandfather Gerald. The boys were the inspiration for the boys in J.M. Barrie' Peter Pan (1924) and his Neverland works.) Her husband was also famous: Frederick A. M. Browning, the WWII Commander \"Boy\" Browning renowned as the \"father of the British airborne forces.\" He helped plan and execute Operation Market Garden, an airborne operation that put Allied troops into Germany and the Netherlands, an ultimately unsuccessful venture chronicled in Cornelius Ryan's A Bridge Too Far (1977). During the Second World War, Boy Browning achieved the rank of Lieutenant General and a knighthood. Daphne published her first short story in 1928; her first novel, \"The Loving Spirit\", was published in 1931, and her last, \"Rule Britannia\", forty-one year later. In between, she achieved her greatest success with the novel Rebecca (1940), which was adapted by Alfred Hitchcock into a classic film that won the Best Picture Oscar for 1940. Another novel, Don't Look Now (1973), adapted by Nicolas Roeg, is also considered a classic film in Britain. Along with \"Rebecca\", she had great successes with her novels Jamaica Inn (1939) and Frenchman's Creek (1944), both of which were adapted into movies. The three novels were set in Cornwall, where she lived. In addition to multiple non-fiction books, Daphne Du Maurier also wrote three plays (including an adaptation of \"Rebecca\"). She died on April 19, 1989, in Par in her beloved Cornwall, five weeks shy of her 82nd birthday.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0238898","name":"Daphne Du Maurier","idIMDB":"nm0238898","filmographies":[{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"My Cousin Rachel","year":" 2017","remarks":["(novel)"],"imdbid":"tt4411596"},{"title":"Jamaica Inn","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)","(novel - 3 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt3098842"},{"title":"Le général du roi","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(novel)"],"imdbid":"tt3225966"},{"title":"The Scapegoat","year":" 2012","remarks":["(story)"],"imdbid":"tt2084977"},{"title":"Anamika: The Untold Story","year":" 2008","remarks":["(novel - uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0885398"},{"title":"Rebecca, la prima moglie","year":" 2008","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(novel)"],"imdbid":"tt1083855"},{"title":"Frenchman's Creek","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(novel)"],"imdbid":"tt0179817"},{"title":"Rebecca","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)","(novel - 2 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt0119991"},{"title":"L'auberge de la Jamaïque","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(novel)"],"imdbid":"tt0166494"},{"title":"La brèche","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(based on short story \"The Breakthrough\" by)"],"imdbid":"tt0110351"},{"title":"The Birds II: Land's End","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(short story)"],"imdbid":"tt0109275"},{"title":"Utharam","year":" 1989","remarks":["(book story)"],"imdbid":"tt0253873"},{"title":"Morning Patrol","year":" 1987","remarks":["(excerpt)"],"imdbid":"tt0093791"},{"title":"Jamaica Inn","year":" 1983","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(novel)"],"imdbid":"tt0089363"},{"title":"My Cousin Rachel","year":" 1983","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)","(novel - 4 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt0085061"},{"title":"Guiding Light","year":" 1982","remarks":["(TV Series)","(certain characters created by - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0044265"},{"title":"Rebecca","year":" 1979","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)","(novel)"],"imdbid":"tt0077067"},{"title":"Une seconde d'éternité","year":" 1977","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(short story)"],"imdbid":"tt1511508"},{"title":"BBC2 Playhouse","year":" 1975","remarks":["(TV Series)","(1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0762803"},{"title":"Kaniz","year":" 1974","remarks":["(novel)"],"imdbid":"tt1091793"},{"title":"Rex Harrison Presents Stories of Love","year":" 1974","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(story - segment \"Kiss Me Again Stranger\")"],"imdbid":"tt0072083"},{"title":"Don't Look Now","year":" 1973","remarks":["(story)"],"imdbid":"tt0069995"},{"title":"Alta comedia","year":" 1973","remarks":["(TV Series)","(1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0373476"},{"title":"Rebecca","year":" 1969","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(novel)"],"imdbid":"tt1337019"},{"title":"Mi amor por ti","year":" 1969","remarks":["(TV Series)","(novel - 3 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt0328764"},{"title":"Kiskanç kadin","year":" 1966","remarks":["(novel \"Rebecca\" - uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0418793"},{"title":"Ocho estrellas en busca del amor","year":" 1964","remarks":["(TV Series)","(1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt4919646"},{"title":"Grande Teatro Tupi","year":" ","remarks":["(TV Series)","(1 episode, 1958)","(novel - 3 episodes, 1952 - 1963)"],"imdbid":"tt1529717"},{"title":"The Birds","year":" 1963","remarks":["(from the story by)"],"imdbid":"tt0056869"},{"title":"Theatre '62","year":" 1962","remarks":["(TV Series)","(novel - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt2199914"},{"title":"The Scapegoat","year":" 1959","remarks":["(novel \"The Scapegoat\")"],"imdbid":"tt0053247"},{"title":"Pursuit","year":" 1958","remarks":["(TV Series)","(story - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0051304"},{"title":"Suspicion","year":" 1958","remarks":["(TV Series)","(story - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0050064"},{"title":"September Tide","year":" 1958","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt3510002"},{"title":"Playhouse 90","year":" 1958","remarks":["(TV Series)","(story - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0048893"},{"title":"Matinee Theatre","year":" 1956","remarks":["(TV Series)","(story - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0047756"},{"title":"H.M.
