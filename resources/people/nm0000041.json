Within a few years, Kurosawa had achieved sufficient stature to allow him greater creative freedom. Drunken Angel (1948)--\"Drunken Angel\"--was the first film he made without extensive studio interference, and marked his first collaboration with Toshirô Mifune. In the coming decades, the two would make 16 movies together, and Mifune became as closely associated with Kurosawa's films as was John Wayne with the films of Kurosawa's idol, John Ford. After working in a wide range of genres, Kurosawa made his international breakthrough film Rashomon (1950) in 1950. It won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, and first revealed the richness of Japanese cinema to the West. The next few years saw the low-key, touching Ikiru (1952) (Living), the epic Seven Samurai (1954), the barbaric, riveting Shakespeare adaptation Throne of Blood (1957), and a fun pair of samurai comedies Yojimbo (1961) and Sanjuro (1962). After a lean period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, though, Kurosawa attempted suicide. He survived, and made a small, personal, low-budget picture with Dodes'ka-den (1970), a larger-scale Russian co-production Dersu Uzala (1975) and, with the help of admirers Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, the samurai tale Kagemusha, l'ombre du guerrier (1980), which Kurosawa described as a dry run for Ran (1985), an epic adaptation of Shakespeare's \"King Lear.\" He continued to work into his eighties with the more personal Dreams (1990), Rhapsodie en août (1991) and Maadadayo (1993). Kurosawa's films have always been more popular in the West than in his native Japan, where critics have viewed his adaptations of Western genres and authors (William Shakespeare, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Maxim Gorky and Evan Hunter) with suspicion - but he's revered by American and European film-makers, who remade Rashomon (1950) as The Outrage (1964), Seven Samurai (1954), as The Magnificent Seven (1960), Yojimbo (1961), as A Fistful of Dollars (1964) and The Hidden Fortress (1958), as Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3ODQwNTY2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTI5ODM1Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000041","name":"Akira Kurosawa","nicknames":["The Emperor","Wind Man"],"idIMDB":"nm0000041","filmographies":[{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"Nioh","year":" 2017","remarks":["(Video Game)","(based on original material by)"],"imdbid":"tt5818106"},{"title":"The Magnificent Seven","year":" 2016","remarks":["(based on the screenplay by)"],"imdbid":"tt2404435"},{"title":"Stray Dog","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(based on a script by)"],"imdbid":"tt2585254"},{"title":"The Outrage","year":" 2011","remarks":["(based on screenplay by)"],"imdbid":"tt2190475"},{"title":"Hidden Fortress: The Last Princess","year":" 2008","remarks":["(original screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt1134519"},{"title":"Tsubaki Sanjûrô","year":" 2007","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0905366"},{"title":"Samurai 7","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Series)","(film \"Shichinin no samurai\" - 26 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt0482424"},{"title":"The Sea Is Watching","year":" 2002","remarks":["(original screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0316829"},{"title":"Dora-heita","year":" 2000","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0236167"},{"title":"Après la pluie","year":" 1999","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0181960"},{"title":"Last Man Standing","year":" 1996","remarks":["(story)"],"imdbid":"tt0116830"},{"title":"Maadadayo","year":" 1993","remarks":["(writer)"],"imdbid":"tt0107474"},{"title":"Rhapsodie en août","year":" 1991","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0101991"},{"title":"Dreams","year":" 1990","remarks":["(written by)"],"imdbid":"tt0100998"},{"title":"Fame","year":" 1986","remarks":["(TV Series)","(based on the Japanese Daiei film \"Rashomon\" by - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0083412"},{"title":"Runaway Train","year":" 1985","remarks":["(based on a screenplay by)"],"imdbid":"tt0089941"},{"title":"Ran","year":" 1985","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0089881"},{"title":"Kagemusha, l'ombre du guerrier","year":" 1980","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0080979"},{"title":"Dersu Uzala","year":" 1975","remarks":["(screenplay - as Akira Kurosava)"],"imdbid":"tt0071411"},{"title":"Nora inu","year":" 1973","remarks":["(1949 screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0329431"},{"title":"Dodes'ka-den","year":" 1970","remarks":["(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt0065649"},{"title":"Tora!
