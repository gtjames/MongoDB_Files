{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"11 March 1969","placeOfBirth":" Chicago, Illinois, USA","birthName":"Terrence Dashon Howard","height":"6' 0½\" (1.84 m)","bio":"Terrence Howard was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Anita Jeanine Williams (née Hawkins) and Tyrone Howard. He was raised in Cleveland, Ohio. His love for acting came naturally, through summers spent with his great-grandmother, New York stage actress Minnie Gentry. He later began his acting career after being discovered on a New York City street by a casting director. Soon, he followed with several notable TV appearances on shows such as Living Single (1993), NYPD Blue (1993) and Soul Food (2000). He became well known for his lead role in the UPN TV series Sparks (1996). Howard broke onto the big screen with his riveting performance in Mr. Holland's Opus (1995). Howard's most memorable performances to date are of scene-stealing characters such as \"Cowboy\" in the Hughes brother's film Dead Presidents (1995) and as \"Quentin\" in Malcolm D. Lee's Independent film The Best Man (1999). The latter earning him a NAACP Image Award, Independent Spirit Award nomination and a Chicago Film Critics Award nomination. A self taught musician, Howard plays both the piano and the guitar. You can see Terrence display his musical talents opposite Jamie Foxx in this year's breakout film Ray (2004). A promising songwriter, Howard's lyrics are soon to be acquired by some of today's biggest artists. In addition to his musical talents, Howard also has a strong interest in science.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3NTY4NzgyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEzNTkxNg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005024","name":"Terrence
