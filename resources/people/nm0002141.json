She would study acting at the University of Chicago and make her stage debut in 1936. Her Broadway debut came when she was 19. She appeared in many successful plays, including \"The Women\", \"Oklahoma!\" and \"Bloomer Girl\". It was in the production of \"Oklahoma!\" that Celeste would sing the showstopper, \"I Cain't Say No\". She was signed by 20th Century Fox in 1946 and appeared in her first film, Three Little Girls in Blue (1946). With her third film, Gentleman's Agreement (1947), she would win the Supporting Actress Oscar and a Golden Globe. Celeste would be nominated twice more for Academy Awards in the Come to the Stable (1949) and All About Eve (1950). But, Celeste was a star who loved the stage so she left Hollywood, only to return for two MGM musicals in the 1950s. They were The Tender Trap (1955) and High Society (1956). In addition to her stage career, Celeste appeared on television in her own series, Honestly, Celeste! (1954) and as a panelist on Who Pays? (1959). In 1970, Celeste returned to television series as the chaperon to the president's daughter on Nancy (1970). For the next two decades, she would appear on television in regular series, miniseries and movies. Celeste Holm died at age 95 of a heart attack on July 15, 2012.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNDgzNDg3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzkyNTc1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002141","name":"Celeste Holm","idIMDB":"nm0002141","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"College Debts","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1437370"},{"title":"Driving Me Crazy","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1109587"},{"title":"Alchemy","year":" 2005/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0285682"},{"title":"Whoopi","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0364902"},{"title":"Third Watch","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0197182"},{"title":"The Beat","year":" 2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0231013"},{"title":"Promised Land","year":" 1996-1999","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115325"},{"title":"Touched by an Angel","year":" 1996-1998","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0108968"},{"title":"Still Breathing","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0120211"},{"title":"Home of the Brave","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0158659"},{"title":"Once You Meet a Stranger","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0117244"},{"title":"Great Performances","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0159876"},{"title":"Cheers","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0083399"},{"title":"Loving","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0085049"},{"title":"Polly: Comin' Home!","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0100385"},{"title":"Christine Cromwell","year":" 1989-1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096558"},{"title":"Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color","year":" 1965-1989","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0046593"},{"title":"CBS Summer Playhouse","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0346222"},{"title":"Nora's Christmas Gift","year":" 1989","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt0452829"},{"title":"Spenser: For Hire","year":" 1988","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0088612"},{"title":"3 Men and a Baby","year":" 1987","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0094137"},{"title":"Magnum, P.I.","year":" 1987","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0080240"},{"title":"Murder by the Book","year":" 1987","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0093585"},{"title":"Falcon Crest","year":" 1985","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0081858"},{"title":"Matt Houston","year":" 1985","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0083447"},{"title":"Jessie","year":" 1984","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0087502"},{"title":"The Love Boat","year":" 1979-1984","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0075529"},{"title":"Jessie","year":" 1984","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0086738"},{"title":"This Girl for Hire","year":" 1983","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0086430"},{"title":"Archie Bunker's Place","year":" 1981-1983","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0078562"},{"title":"Trapper John, M.D.","year":" 1979-1982","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0078704"},{"title":"American Playhouse","year":" 1982","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0176357"},{"title":"Midnight Lace","year":" 1981","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0081158"},{"title":"Fantasy Island","year":" 1978-1979","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0077008"},{"title":"Backstairs at the White House","year":" 1979","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0078565"},{"title":"Lucan","year":" 1978","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0075532"},{"title":"The Private Files of J.
