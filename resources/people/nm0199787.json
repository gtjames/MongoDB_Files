He entered films in 1929, and excelled at playing the suave, well-bred villain who could kill an enemy or start a war with a certain air of upper-class disdain, as if all of this effort was beneath him. His long and distinguished career ended in 1963, when he suffered a heart attack while filming My Fair Lady (1964).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxNDk5NzQ1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTg5MjgwOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0199787","name":"Henry
