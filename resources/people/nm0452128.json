{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"6 March 1882","placeOfBirth":" El Paso, Texas, USA","birthName":"Guy Bridges Kibbee","bio":"Beginning his show business career at age 13 as an entertainer on Mississippi riverboats, Guy Kibbee graduated to the legitimate stage and spent many years in the theater. In the 1930s he was signed by Warner Brothers, and became part of what was known as \"the Warner Brothers Stock Company\", a cadre of seasoned character actors and actresses who enlivened many a Warners musical or gangster film. Kibbee specialized in playing jovial, but not particularly bright, businessmen and government officials. He was memorable as the stuffy lawyer with a secret weakness for showgirls in Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGZhYzM0MWUtYTk1Yi00NDJkLTg0MDktNGI1NjMzMmNhYmNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDMxMjQwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0452128","name":"Guy
