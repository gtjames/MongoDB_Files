His first acting experience soon after school in 1955, was an amateur production of 'Doctor in the House' which persuaded him he wanted to be an actor. After leaving school he worked in a bank and then for Central African Airlines. In 1958, he made his first trip from Rhodesia to England to get a lie of the land. In 1960 he moved to England and landed his first small role in the film Flame in the Streets (1960) and then played on of the bells boys in Arthur Koppits \"Oh Dad Poor Dad Mama's hung you in the Closet and I'm feeling so Sad\" (1961) with Stella Adler playing Madame Rosepettle. He then bluffed his way into Weekly Repertory in Barrow-in-Furness as Juvenile lead - terrified the while that he would be exposed as totally inexperienced. Recognising the need for training he auditioned three times for a bursary to RADA - each time only being accepted as a fee paying student which he couldn't afford - he finally sent for the last of his standby money (£200) he had left in Rhodesia and paid for the first term (1963)","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NDEzMzcyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA5NzA1OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0047549","name":"David Bailie","idIMDB":"nm0047549","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"The Beyond","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5723416"},{"title":"The Timber","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2215673"},{"title":"Artificio Conceal","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt3683122"},{"title":"October 1","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3206616"},{"title":"Traveller","year":" 2013/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2343807"},{"title":"Clubs & Styx","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt4416262"},{"title":"Sinbad","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1979918"},{"title":"The Bottle","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1985221"},{"title":"Pirates of the Caribbean: Tales of the Code: Wedlocked","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt2092452"},{"title":"Tribe","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1581846"},{"title":"Every Occupation Needs a Party","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1670988"},{"title":"Shadows in the Wind","year":" 2009","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1352785"},{"title":"Eddie Proctor","year":" 2007","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1217025"},{"title":"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0449088"},{"title":"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0383574"},{"title":"Starfly","year":" 2005","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0487048"},{"title":"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0325980"},{"title":"Attila","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0259127"},{"title":"Gladiator","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0172495"},{"title":"The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0151137"},{"title":"Les nouvelles aventures de Robin des bois","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115289"},{"title":"Cutthroat Island","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0112760"},{"title":"Henry IV Part I","year":" 1979","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0079287"},{"title":"Blakes 7","year":" 1978","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0076987"},{"title":"Golden Rendezvous","year":" 1977","remarks":["Younger terrorist in car (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0076091"},{"title":"Doctor Who","year":" 1977","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0056751"},{"title":"Warship","year":" 1977","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0139806"},{"title":"Plays for Britain","year":" 1976","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1595052"},{"title":"BBC Play of the Month","year":" 1975","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0165593"},{"title":"Softly Softly: Task Force","year":" 1975","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1868096"},{"title":"Legend of the Werewolf","year":" 1975","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0073275"},{"title":"Churchill's People","year":" 1975","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0071325"},{"title":"Son of Dracula","year":" 1974","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0072189"},{"title":"Play for Today","year":" 1974","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0165592"},{"title":"Wipers Three","year":" 1973","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt1933682"},{"title":"The Regiment","year":" 1973","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0163486"},{"title":"The Creeping Flesh","year":" 1973","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0068424"},{"title":"Adam Smith","year":" 1972","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0164241"},{"title":"Henry VIII and His Six Wives","year":" 1972","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0070170"},{"title":"The Visitors","year":" 1972","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0497158"},{"title":"The Fenn Street Gang","year":" 1971","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0069584"},{"title":"All's Well That Ends Well","year":" 1968","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0062651"},{"title":"Ransom for a Pretty Girl","year":" 1966","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0416415"},{"title":"Flame in the Streets","year":" 1961","remarks":["(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0054879"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Fire, Plague, War and Treason","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0320004"}]},{"section":"Archive footage","filmography":[{"title":"Planet Voice","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0778564"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/15 01:29:33"}}
