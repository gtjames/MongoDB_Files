Fred entered show business at age 5. He was successful both in vaudeville and on Broadway in partnership with his sister, Adele Astaire. After Adele retired to marry in 1932, Astaire headed to Hollywood. Signed to RKO, he was loaned to MGM to appear in Dancing Lady (1933) before starting work on RKO's Flying Down to Rio (1933). In the latter film, he began his highly successful partnership with Ginger Rogers, with whom he danced in 9 RKO pictures. During these years, he was also active in recording and radio. On film, Astaire later appeared opposite a number of partners through various studios. After a temporary retirement in 1945-7, during which he opened Fred Astaire Dance Studios, Astaire returned to film to star in more musicals through 1957. He subsequently performed a number of straight dramatic roles in film and TV.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTU0NDYzMjA1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTIzNjM2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000001","name":"Fred Astaire","idIMDB":"nm0000001","filmographies":[{"section":"Soundtrack","filmography":[{"title":"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)","(performer - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt5435008"},{"title":"20th Century Women","year":" 2016","remarks":["(performer: \"This Heart of Mine\")"],"imdbid":"tt4385888"},{"title":"Cuéntame","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)","(performer - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0302447"},{"title":"Call the Midwife","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)","(performer - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt1983079"},{"title":"Dancing with the Stars","year":" 2006-2014","remarks":["(TV Series)","(2 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt0463398"},{"title":"Cake","year":" 2014/II","remarks":["(performer: \"Dig It\")"],"imdbid":"tt3442006"},{"title":"Broadway Therapy","year":" 2014","remarks":["(performer: \"Cheek to Cheek\", \"Steppin' Out With My Baby\")"],"imdbid":"tt1767372"},{"title":"Supernatural","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)","(performer - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0460681"},{"title":"Mildred Pierce","year":" ","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)","(performer - 1 episode, 2011)","(writer - 1 episode, 2011)"],"imdbid":"tt1492030"},{"title":"Moguls & Movie Stars: A History of Hollywood","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series documentary)","(performer - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt1759310"},{"title":"Step Up 3D","year":" 2010","remarks":["(performer: \"I Won't Dance\")"],"imdbid":"tt1193631"},{"title":"Doctors","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series)","(performer - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0241383"},{"title":"Johnny Mercer: The Dream's on Me","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)","(music: \"I'm Building Up to an Awful Let-Down\")","/ (performer: \"One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)","\", \"That's Entertainment\", \"Dearly Beloved\", \"Something's Gotta Give\")"],"imdbid":"tt1543216"},{"title":"Hollywood Singing and Dancing: A Musical History - The 1930s: Dancing Away the Great Depression","year":" 2009","remarks":["(Video documentary)","(performer: \"Carioca\", \"Poor Mr. Chisholm\", \"Night and Day\", \"I Won't Dance\" - uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt1359579"},{"title":"Hollywood Singing and Dancing: A Musical History - The 1940s: Stars, Stripes and Singing","year":" 2009","remarks":["(Video documentary)","(performer: \"Dig It\", \"Poor Mr. Chisholm\" - uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt1359580"},{"title":"Banda sonora","year":" 2008","remarks":["(TV Series)","(performer - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt1126592"},{"title":"A Trip to Swadades","year":" 2008","remarks":["(performer: \"This Heart of Mine\")"],"imdbid":"tt1270796"},{"title":"Hollywood Singing and Dancing: A Musical Treasure","year":" 2008","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)","(performer: \"Carioca\", \"Waltz in Swing Time\", \"You're All the World to Me\" - uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt1147738"},{"title":"Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Series)","(performer - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0409608"},{"title":"Secret Diary of a Call Girl","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Series)","(performer - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt1000734"},{"title":"American Masters","year":" 1999-2007","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)","(performer - 2 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt0364151"},{"title":"Chacun son cinéma ou Ce petit coup au coeur quand la lumière s'éteint et que le film commence","year":" 2007","remarks":["(performer: \"Cheek to Cheek\")"],"imdbid":"tt0973844"},{"title":"ShowBusiness: The Road to Broadway","year":" 2007","remarks":["(Documentary)","(performer: \"Puttin' on the Ritz\")"],"imdbid":"tt0456004"},{"title":"Gilmore Girls","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Series)","(performer - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0238784"},{"title":"La caravane de l'étrange","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Series)","(performer - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0319969"},{"title":"Los nuevos y clásicos bloopers","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Series)","(performer - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt5607020"},{"title":"Angels in America","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)","(performer - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0318997"},{"title":"Pepper Chocolate","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series)","(performer: \"Puttin' on the Ritz\")"],"imdbid":"tt0380096"},{"title":"The Dreamers","year":" 2003","remarks":["(performer: \"No Strings (I'm Fancy Free)","\" (1935)",")"],"imdbid":"tt0309987"},{"title":"The Human Stain","year":" 2003","remarks":["(performer: \"Cheek to Cheek\" (1936)",")"],"imdbid":"tt0308383"},{"title":"A.I.
