{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"20 July 1937","placeOfBirth":" Detroit, Michigan, USA","birthName":"Timothy Christopher Scott","bio":"Tim Scott was tall and thin, who sometimes went unshaven, and because of this somewhat unsavory look he was often cast in westerns. He was born in Detroit, Michigan, but as a young boy moved with his family to Albuquerque, New Mexico. He loved the theater deeply and he became the co-founder of the \"New MET Theatre\" in Los Angeles, California, with one of his best friends, actor James Gammon. Tim died unexpectedly at the age of 57 from complications of lung cancer in Los Angeles, California, on 15 June 1995. He was a fabulous actor and is dearly missed by many.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGRmY2U3MzMtMDYzNS00YTc4LWFhYmYtZmFmNDQ4MGFmYTNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI3MDk3MzQ@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0779850","name":"Timothy Scott","nicknames":["Tim"],"idIMDB":"nm0779850","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Lone Justice 2","year":" 1995","remarks":["(as Tim Scott)"],"imdbid":"tt0113686"},{"title":"Blue Sky","year":" 1994","remarks":["Ned Owens (as Tim Scott)"],"imdbid":"tt0109306"},{"title":"Clean Slate","year":" 1994","remarks":["(as Tim Scott)"],"imdbid":"tt0109443"},{"title":"Return to Lonesome Dove","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106112"},{"title":"Gettysburg","year":" 1993","remarks":["(as Tim Scott)"],"imdbid":"tt0107007"},{"title":"Ned Blessing: The Story of My Life and Times","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106081"},{"title":"Class of '61","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(as Tim Scott)"],"imdbid":"tt0106578"},{"title":"Le gardien des esprits","year":" 1993","remarks":["The Lone Man (as Tim Scott)"],"imdbid":"tt0108135"},{"title":"The Switch","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Movie)","Larry's Father (as Tim Scott)"],"imdbid":"tt0108266"},{"title":"Ned Blessing: The True Story of My Life","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Movie)","Deputy Sticks Packwood (as Tim Scott)"],"imdbid":"tt0104977"},{"title":"Fried Green Tomatoes","year":" 1991","remarks":["(as Tim Scott)"],"imdbid":"tt0101921"},{"title":"Down Home","year":" 1990-1991","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098778"},{"title":"Alien Nation","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096531"},{"title":"I Love You Perfect","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Movie)","Red (as Tim Scott)"],"imdbid":"tt0097554"},{"title":"Chattahoochee","year":" 1989","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0099242"},{"title":"Lonesome Dove","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096639"},{"title":"Dark Before Dawn","year":" 1988","remarks":["Ollie (as Tim Scott)"],"imdbid":"tt0097156"},{"title":"The Town Bully","year":" 1988","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0096293"},{"title":"Big Shots","year":" 1987","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0092655"},{"title":"The Abduction of Kari Swenson","year":" 1987","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0092506"},{"title":"Milwr Bychan","year":" 1986","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0091521"},{"title":"Eye of the Tiger","year":" 1986","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0091027"},{"title":"Inside Out","year":" 1986","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0091268"},{"title":"Dream West","year":" 1986","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0090422"},{"title":"Crazy Like a Fox","year":" 1986","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0086691"},{"title":"Cheers","year":" 1986","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0083399"},{"title":"Fever Pitch","year":" 1985","remarks":["(as Tim Scott)"],"imdbid":"tt0089139"},{"title":"Wildside","year":" 1985","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0088642"},{"title":"Hell Town","year":" 1985","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0089132"},{"title":"The Jeffersons","year":" 1984","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0072519"},{"title":"Footloose","year":" 1984","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0087277"},{"title":"Hardcastle and McCormick","year":" 1984","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0085029"},{"title":"Nightmares","year":" 1983","remarks":["Sheriff (segment \"The Benediction\")"],"imdbid":"tt0086014"},{"title":"Eureka","year":" 1983","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0083906"},{"title":"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers","year":" 1983","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0083476"},{"title":"Little House on the Prairie","year":" 1983","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0071007"},{"title":"American Playhouse","year":" 1982","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0176357"},{"title":"T.J.
