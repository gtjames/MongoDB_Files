{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"12 November 1980","placeOfBirth":" London, Ontario, Canada","birthName":"Ryan Thomas Gosling","height":"6' 0½\" (1.84 m)","bio":"Ryan Thomas Gosling was born on November 12, 1980, in London, Ontario, Canada. He is the son of Donna (Wilson), a secretary, and Thomas Ray Gosling, a traveling salesman. Ryan was the second of their two children. His ancestry is French-Canadian, as well as English, Scottish, and German. The Gosling family moved to Cornwall, Ontario, where Ryan grew up and was home-schooled by his mother. Ryan attended Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational High School in Cornwall, where he excelled in Drama and Fine Arts. The family then relocated to Burlington, Ontario, where Ryan attended Lester B. Pearson High School in Burlington, Ontario. Ryan first performed as a singer at talent contests with his older sister Mandi. He attended an open audition in Montreal for the TV series \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" (The All New Mickey Mouse Club (1989)) in January 1993 and beat out 17,000 other aspiring actors for a a spot on the show. While appearing on \"MMC\" for two years, he lived with co-star Justin Timberlake's family. Though he received no formal acting training, after \"MMC,\" Gosling segued into an acting career, appearing on the TV series Young Hercules (1998) and Breaker High (1997), as well as the films The Slaughter Rule (2002), Murder by Numbers (2002), and Remember the Titans (2000). He first attracted serious critical attention with his performance as the Jewish neo-Nazi in the controversial film The Believer (2001), which won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival. He was cast in the part by writer-director Henry Bean, who believed that Gosling's strict upbringing gave him the insight to understand the character Danny, whose obsessiveness with the Judaism he was born into turns to hatred. He was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award as Best Male Lead in 2002 for the role and won the Golden Aries award from the Russian Guild of Film Critics. After appearing in the sleeper The Notebook (2004) in 2004, Gosling won the dubious honor of being named one of the 50 Hottest Bachelors by People Magazine. More significantly, he was named the Male Star of Tomorrow at the 2004 Show West convention of movie exhibitors. Gosling reached the summit of his profession with his performance in Half Nelson (2006), which garnered him an Academy Award nomination as Best Actor. In a short time, he has established himself as one of the finest actors of his generation.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzMjkwNTQ2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQ4MTQ4MTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0331516","name":"Ryan Gosling","idIMDB":"nm0331516","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Blade Runner 2049","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1856101"},{"title":"Song to Song","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2062700"},{"title":"First Man","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1213641"},{"title":"La La Land","year":" 2016/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3783958"},{"title":"The Nice Guys","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3799694"},{"title":"The Big Short","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1596363"},{"title":"Only God Forgives","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1602613"},{"title":"Gangster Squad","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1321870"},{"title":"The Place Beyond the Pines","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1817273"},{"title":"Drunk History Christmas","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt2148935"},{"title":"Touch of Evil","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt2167961"},{"title":"The Ides of March","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1124035"},{"title":"Crazy, Stupid, Love.","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1570728"},{"title":"Drive","year":" 2011/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0780504"},{"title":"All Good Things","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1175709"},{"title":"Blue Valentine","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1120985"},{"title":"Lars and the Real Girl","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0805564"},{"title":"Fracture","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0488120"},{"title":"Half Nelson","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0468489"},{"title":"Stay","year":" 2005/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0371257"},{"title":"I'm Still Here: Real Diaries of Young People Who Lived During the Holocaust","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0464062"},{"title":"The Notebook","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0332280"},{"title":"The United States of Leland","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0301976"},{"title":"Murder by Numbers","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0264935"},{"title":"The Slaughter Rule","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0266971"},{"title":"The Believer","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0247199"},{"title":"Remember the Titans","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0210945"},{"title":"The Unbelievables","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0196178"},{"title":"Young Hercules","year":" 1998-1999","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0169516"},{"title":"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0111999"},{"title":"Breaker High","year":" 1997-1998","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0124934"},{"title":"Nothing Too Good for a Cowboy","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0127389"},{"title":"Psi Factor, chroniques du paranormal","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115326"},{"title":"Frankenstein and Me","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0116356"},{"title":"Ready or Not","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106110"},{"title":"Kung Fu: The Legend Continues","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0103460"},{"title":"Avonlea","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098900"},{"title":"Goosebumps","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0111987"},{"title":"Chahut au bahut","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115173"},{"title":"Les aventures de Shirley Holmes","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115085"},{"title":"Are You Afraid of the Dark?","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0103352"}]},{"section":"Soundtrack","filmography":[{"title":"La La Land","year":" 2016/I","remarks":["(performer: \"A Lovely Night\", \"City of Stars\" (Pier)",", \"City of Stars\")"],"imdbid":"tt3783958"},{"title":"The Stairs","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Short)","(writer: \"In the Room Where You Sleep\")"],"imdbid":"tt4199582"},{"title":"Lost River","year":" 2014","remarks":["(performer: \"Lost River Dance\")"],"imdbid":"tt2366608"},{"title":"The Conjuring","year":" 2013","remarks":["(writer: \"In the Room Where You Sleep\")"],"imdbid":"tt1457767"},{"title":"The Place Beyond the Pines","year":" 2012","remarks":["(performer: \"Borriquito\")"],"imdbid":"tt1817273"},{"title":"Dollhouse","year":" 2012/I","remarks":["(writer: \"Lose Your Soul\", \"Dead Hearts\")"],"imdbid":"tt1930327"},{"title":"Cinema 3","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Series)","(performer -
