{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"15 November 1972","placeOfBirth":" Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, England, UK","birthName":"Jonathan Lee Miller","height":"5' 9¾\" (1.77 m)","bio":"Jonny Lee Miller (sometimes credited with an H) was born on November 15, 1972, in Kingston, England, UK, to actors Anna Lee and Alan Miller, and the grandson of actor Bernard Lee. After appearing in many high school plays at his selective state grammar school, Johnny dropped out at 17, to pursue acting full time. Although he was reportedly quiet and shy in high school, he certainly expresses himself well in all his films. His very first popular film was Hackers (1995), alongside Angelina Jolie and Matthew Lillard. Later his co-star Angelina became his wife. They were divorced 4 years later. Interesting fact is that his entire family is well into acting, all the way back to his grandparents. He has a partnership in the production company, Natural Nylon, which also includes Ewan McGregor and Jude Law.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMjc0NTA2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA4MzQ2OQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001538","name":"Jonny Lee Miller","idIMDB":"nm0001538","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"T2 Trainspotting","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2763304"},{"title":"Elementary","year":" 2012-2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2191671"},{"title":"Byzantium","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1531901"},{"title":"Dark Shadows","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1077368"},{"title":"Frankenstein","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt1795369"},{"title":"Dexter","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0773262"},{"title":"Emma","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1366312"},{"title":"Eli Stone","year":" 2008-2009","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0892535"},{"title":"Endgame","year":" 2009/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1217616"},{"title":"Smith","year":" 2006-2007","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0805667"},{"title":"The Flying Scotsman","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0472268"},{"title":"Æon Flux","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0402022"},{"title":"Melinda and Melinda","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0378947"},{"title":"Mindhunters","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0297284"},{"title":"Canterbury Tales","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0353045"},{"title":"Byron","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0369084"},{"title":"The Escapist","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0299854"},{"title":"Dracula 2000","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0219653"},{"title":"Complicity","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0188518"},{"title":"Love, Honor and Obey","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0199727"},{"title":"Mansfield Park","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0178737"},{"title":"Plunkett & Macleane","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0134033"},{"title":"Behind the Lines","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0120001"},{"title":"Afterglow","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0118566"},{"title":"Dead Man's Walk","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115238"},{"title":"Trainspotting","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0117951"},{"title":"Hackers","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0113243"},{"title":"Screen One","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0297625"},{"title":"Stages","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4106356"},{"title":"Mystery!: Cadfael","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0108717"},{"title":"Prime Suspect 3","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106104"},{"title":"The Bill","year":" 1991-1993","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0084987"},{"title":"EastEnders","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0088512"},{"title":"Bad Company","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0139874"},{"title":"Olly's Prison","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0453527"},{"title":"Screen Two","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0297626"},{"title":"Second Thoughts","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0101194"},{"title":"The Life and Times of Henry Pratt","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0103473"},{"title":"Casualty","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096555"},{"title":"Between the Lines","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0103362"},{"title":"Goodbye Cruel World","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0320019"},{"title":"Minder","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0078657"},{"title":"Inspector Morse","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0092379"},{"title":"4 Play","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1615489"},{"title":"Keeping Up Appearances","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098837"},{"title":"Mansfield Park","year":" 1983","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0085052"},{"title":"Storyboard","year":" 1983","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0400036"},{"title":"Jemima Shore Investigates","year":" 1983","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0161154"},{"title":"Doctor Who","year":" 1982","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0056751"}]},{"section":"Soundtrack","filmography":[{"title":"Love, Honor and Obey","year":" 2000","remarks":["(performer: \"Avenues and Alleyways\")"],"imdbid":"tt0199727"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"CBS This Morning","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2163227"},{"title":"Elementary -
