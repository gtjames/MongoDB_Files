She made her screen debut in the 1994 feature film The Professional, playing the ill fated sister of the main protagonist, Mathilda (played by Natalie Portman). She followed up with roles in the movies Free Country the Movie (1996) and Snapped (1998) before landing a three-episode recurring role as Sandra Reynolds in the television drama Big Apple, in 2001. Her role in Big Apple paved the way for a guest appearance on Law & Order later that year, in the episode entitled \"Bronx Cheer\" (Season 11, Episode 16). Also in 2001, she had a supporting role in the feature film Love The Hard Way, starring Adrien Brody. Regen only made one screen appearance in 2002 - a guest starring role in the Sex And The City episode \"I Love A Charade\" (Season 5, Episode 8). She began 2003 by voicing the role of Sindee Hutton in the video game CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, based on the television series of the same name. In September 2003 she made her first appearance in Whoopi, in the pilot episode. She was one of four regular cast members on the show, which carried her through 22 episodes into 2004. In Whoopi she played the character of Rita, Courtney Rae's 'culturally confused' girlfriend. In 2004, Regen played the role of Maggie Shaye in the feature film Looking for Kitty, which she followed up with a guest appearance in Third Watch, in the episode entitled \"Alone Again, Naturally\" (Season 6, Episode 2). 2005 brought Regen a on-screen lead role as Laura Del Vecchio, in the movie Parting Words. Regen went on to win Best Actress at the Hoboken Film Festival. Parting Words also won Best Film at the Long Island Film Festival. The following year - 2006 - was her busiest to date, with two-episode recurring roles on Modern Men and So NoTORIous; a guest starring role on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (playing the same role she played in the video game); and appearances in two feature films: Beer League and Nail Polish. Regen has a recurring role in the 2007 television crime drama The Black Donnelly's.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NzA1ODQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDU5OTAzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0716408","name":"Elizabeth Regen","idIMDB":"nm0716408","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Masters of Sex","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2137109"},{"title":"2 Broke Girls","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1845307"},{"title":"The Exes","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1830888"},{"title":"Awkward.","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1663676"},{"title":"Bonita & Ronita","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2362948"},{"title":"Entourage","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0387199"},{"title":"The Fallen Faithful","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1232822"},{"title":"Sherri","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1421054"},{"title":"Parting Words","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0475997"},{"title":"American Body Shop","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0876296"},{"title":"The Black Donnellys","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0805661"},{"title":"Nail Polish","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0445035"},{"title":"Beer League","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0453453"},{"title":"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0247082"},{"title":"So Notorious","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0457600"},{"title":"Modern Men","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0445126"},{"title":"Third Watch","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0197182"},{"title":"Looking for Kitty","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0401593"},{"title":"Whoopi","year":" 2003-2004","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0364902"},{"title":"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation","year":" 2003","remarks":["(Video Game)"],"imdbid":"tt0361424"},{"title":"Sex and the City","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0159206"},{"title":"Love the Hard Way","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0263671"},{"title":"Malcolm in the Middle","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0212671"},{"title":"Big Apple","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0277471"},{"title":"Law & Order","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098844"},{"title":"Snapped","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0143885"},{"title":"Free Country the Movie","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0322331"},{"title":"Léon: The Professional","year":" 1994","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0110413"},{"title":"CityKids","year":" 1993","remarks":["(TV Series)","Trish (1993-1994)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0147758"}]},{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"The Fallen Faithful","year":" 2010","remarks":["(written by)"],"imdbid":"tt1232822"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Absolutely Jason Stuart","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3074254"},{"title":"On the Set W Jasper Cole","year":" 2014-2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3419954"},{"title":"Howard Stern on Demand","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0474499"},{"title":"My Coolest Years","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0437735"},{"title":"The View","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0123366"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/15 05:43:28"}}
