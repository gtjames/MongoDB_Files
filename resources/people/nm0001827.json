When the family moved to Houston, Texas, Walston's father wanted to teach him the oil business, but Walston instead joined a traveling repertory company (selling tickets as well as acting). He went on to associate with Margo Jones at the Houston Civic Theater for six years, then spent three seasons with the Cleveland Playhouse before arriving in New York in 1945. He has won a Tony Award for his performance as the Devil in Broadway's \"Damn Yankees\", two Emmy Awards for Picket Fences (1992), and become a household name playing the extraterrestrial \"Uncle Martin\" on My Favorite Martian (1963). Ray Walston died at age 86 of lupus on New Year's Day 2001 in Beverly Hills, California.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMzIzNzAxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzg5NTM2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001827","name":"Ray Walston","idIMDB":"nm0001827","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"7th Heaven","year":" 1998-2001","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0115083"},{"title":"Early Bird Special","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0164555"},{"title":"Touched by an Angel","year":" 2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0108968"},{"title":"Ally McBeal","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0118254"},{"title":"Swing Vote","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0181040"},{"title":"Star Trek: Voyager","year":" 1998-1999","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0112178"},{"title":"My Favorite Martian","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0120764"},{"title":"Addams Family Reunion","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0146402"},{"title":"Tricks","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0127328"},{"title":"The Westing Game","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0120495"},{"title":"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0103405"},{"title":"Dave's World","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0105982"},{"title":"House Arrest","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0116571"},{"title":"Picket Fences","year":" 1992-1996","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0103512"},{"title":"Mixed Nuts","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt1210327"},{"title":"Le projet ALF","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0117397"},{"title":"The Stand","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0108941"},{"title":"Space Case","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0444979"},{"title":"L'as de la crime","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0101069"},{"title":"Of Mice and Men","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0105046"},{"title":"The Player","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0105151"},{"title":"Star Trek: The Next Generation","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0092455"},{"title":"Eerie, Indiana","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0101088"},{"title":"One Special Victory","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0102596"},{"title":"Dream On","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098780"},{"title":"Pink Lightning","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0102671"},{"title":"Parker Lewis Can't Lose","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098888"},{"title":"ABC Weekend Specials","year":" 1986-1991","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0075471"},{"title":"Popcorn","year":" 1991","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0102690"},{"title":"Angel of Death","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0099041"},{"title":"Blood Salvage","year":" 1990","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0099153"},{"title":"Hurricane Sam","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt1146286"},{"title":"L.A.
