{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"4 November 1971","placeOfBirth":" Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India","birthName":"Tabassum Hashmi","height":"5' 8½\" (1.74 m)","bio":"Tabu is an Indian actress. She has mainly acted in Hindi films, though she has also starred in Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Marathi and Bengali-language films, as well as one American film. She has won the National Film Award for Best Actress twice, and holds the record for the most wins of Filmfare's Critics Award for Best Female Performer, with four. With few exceptions, she is best known for acting in artistic, low-budget films that go on to garner more critical appreciation than substantial box-office figures. Her appearances in commercially successful films were few, and her parts in these films were small, such as Border (1997), Saajan Chale Sasural (1996), Biwi No. 1 (1999) and Hum Saath-Saath Hain: We Stand United (1999). Her most notable performances include Maachis (1996), Virasat (1997), Hu Tu Tu (1999), Astitva (2000), Chandni Bar (2001), Maqbool (2003) and Cheeni Kum (2007). Her leading role in Mira Nair's American film The Namesake (2006) also drew major praise. Regarded as one of the most talented Indian actresses of her generation, Tabu is known to be selective about her film roles. She was awarded the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian award, in 2011 by the Government of India for her contributions towards the arts.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0ODQ2MjA5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjczMjA0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007102","name":"Tabu","idIMDB":"nm0007102","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Fitoor","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4399594"},{"title":"Talvar","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4934950"},{"title":"Drishyam","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4430212"},{"title":"Haider","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3390572"},{"title":"Jai Ho","year":" 2014/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1188982"},{"title":"David","year":" 2013/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2358412"},{"title":"Life of Pi","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0454876"},{"title":"Parda Parda","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt5471200"},{"title":"Urumi: The Warriors Who Wanted to Kill Vasco Da Gama","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1745863"},{"title":"Khuda Kasam","year":" 2010","remarks":["Neetu Singh (as Tabbu)"],"imdbid":"tt1920986"},{"title":"Toh Baat Pakki!","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1605778"},{"title":"Pandurangadu","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1285131"},{"title":"Idhi Sangathi","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1606247"},{"title":"Cheeni Kum","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0976026"},{"title":"Sarhad Paar","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0476861"},{"title":"The Namesake","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0433416"},{"title":"Phir Hera Pheri","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0419058"},{"title":"Fanaa","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0439662"},{"title":"Shock","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0843379"},{"title":"Silsiilay","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0438981"},{"title":"Andarivaadu","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0431776"},{"title":"Bhagmati","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0419499"},{"title":"Ek Aur Himmatwala","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4944360"},{"title":"Meri Zindagi Ek Agneepath","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4887312"},{"title":"Sangarsh the Struggle","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6332570"},{"title":"Main Hoon Na","year":" 2004","remarks":["Spectator at Ram's dance rehearsal (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0347473"},{"title":"Meenaxi: Tale of 3 Cities","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0366761"},{"title":"Maqbool","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0379370"},{"title":"Jaal: The Trap","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0340178"},{"title":"Hawa","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0369516"},{"title":"Khanjar","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0373970"},{"title":"In the Forest...
