However, few realise that Marion was also a talented screenwriter who, with her husband, formed a successful production team. Born Joey Marion McReery, she began her career as a Mack Sennet Bathing Girl. She soon progressed to become a popular figure in two-reelers and serials. On one of these, 'Mary of the Movies' (1923) she featured - uncredited - as screenwriter as well as star, something she was to do many times. She did not earn her first credit until 1938 - `and only because I insisted'. She married the movie's producer, Lewis Lewyn, in 1924. She heard of the part in `The General' through her hairdresser. The resulting six month shoot was arduous, and Marion decided afterwards that she would rather quit acting than endure such a long separation from her husband again. Her last starring appearance was in `Alice in Movieland' (1927). From then on, her work was mainly done behind the camera. She and her husband produced a number of successful series of shorts, including as `Voice of Hollywood' and `Hollywood on Parade'. Soon after Lewis' death in 1969, interest in `The General' was revived and Marion toured extensively with the movie, giving interviews and lectures about working with the comic legend Buster Keaton.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4OTU2NzI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjEyMjkxNDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0533045","name":"Marion Mack","idIMDB":"nm0533045","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Alice in Movieland","year":" 1940","remarks":["(Short)","Well-Wisher at Train Station (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0032192"},{"title":"Alice in Movieland","year":" 1928","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1029256"},{"title":"The General","year":" 1926","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0017925"},{"title":"The Carnival Girl","year":" 1926","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0016711"},{"title":"One of the Bravest","year":" 1925","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0016183"},{"title":"Mary of the Movies","year":" 1923","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0014262"},{"title":"The Cowpuncher's Comeback","year":" 1921","remarks":["(Short)","Betty Thompson (as Joey McCreery)"],"imdbid":"tt0012075"},{"title":"Reputation","year":" 1921","remarks":["Ingenue (stage sequence)","(as Joey McCreery)"],"imdbid":"tt0012619"},{"title":"On a Summer Day","year":" 1921","remarks":["(Short)","Farmerette (as Joey McCreery)"],"imdbid":"tt0193361"}]},{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"Soaring Stars","year":" 1942","remarks":["(Short)","(screenplay)"],"imdbid":"tt1409609"},{"title":"Rodeo Dough","year":" 1940","remarks":["(Short)","(screen play)"],"imdbid":"tt0217009"},{"title":"Streamlined Swing","year":" 1938","remarks":["(Short)","(screen play)"],"imdbid":"tt0152606"},{"title":"Mary of the Movies","year":" 1923","remarks":["(scenario)"],"imdbid":"tt0014262"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0172202"},{"title":"Hollywood","year":" 1980","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0080230"},{"title":"The Voice of Hollywood No. 3","year":" 1930/II","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt2038305"},{"title":"The Voice of Hollywood No. 3","year":" 1930/I","remarks":["(Short)","Herself (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0295678"},{"title":"Screen Snapshots, Series 1, No. 21","year":" 1921","remarks":["(Documentary short)","Herself (as Joey McCreery)"],"imdbid":"tt2153945"}]},{"section":"Archive footage","filmography":[{"title":"The Golden Age of Buster Keaton","year":" 1975","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0150746"},{"title":"The Great Stone Face","year":" 1968","remarks":["(Documentary)","Annabelle Lee (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0249555"},{"title":"The Great Chase","year":" 1962","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0057114"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/15 04:40:19"}}
