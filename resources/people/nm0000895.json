Born in New York City on Halloween Day 1922, the daughter of noted theatrical and industrial designer Norman Bel Geddes, who staged more than 200 plays. After growing up amidst the theatre, Bel Geddes began acting on stage at age 18 and soon moved on to Broadway. The silver screen also beckoned, making her film debut in The Long Night (1947). She was quickly labeled a star, gracing the cover of Life magazine on April 12, 1948. Her third motion picture, I Remember Mama (1948), garnered Bel Geddes an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress. Other notable films include Panic in the Streets (1950) directed by Elia Kazan; Alfred Hitchcock's classic mystery-thriller Vertigo (1958) with James Stewart and Kim Novak; and The Five Pennies (1959) opposite Danny Kaye. Though she achieved immediate success in films, Bel Geddes also continued to tread the boards on Broadway, since theatre was her first love. In 1952, she received the prestigious Woman of the Year Award by Hasty Pudding Theatricals USA, America's oldest theater company. She was nominated for Tony Awards as best dramatic actress for Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in 1956 and for the lead in Mary, Mary in 1961. Bel Geddes made several TV appearances on Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955) and other programs in the mid-50s, but her greatest television role came as Miss Ellie Ewing Farlow on Dallas (1978), which enjoyed a run of 13 years (1978-1991). She won the Emmy Award for best actress in 1980 and was nominated in the same category in 1979 and 1981. Bel Geddes left the show for health reasons during the 1984-85 season, with Donna Reed taking over the role of Miss Ellie. Bel Geddes returned for the 1985-86 season and continued on Dallas (1978) until 1990, when she effectively retired from acting. She did not appear in either of the two Dallas TV reunion movies. On August 8, 2005, she died following a long illness.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzOTg1OTg5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTYyMDEzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000895","name":"Barbara Bel Geddes","idIMDB":"nm0000895","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Dallas","year":" 1978-1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0077000"},{"title":"Our Town","year":" 1977","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0081290"},{"title":"Spencer's Pilots","year":" 1976","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0074059"},{"title":"The Todd Killings","year":" 1971","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0066463"},{"title":"Summertree","year":" 1971","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0067804"},{"title":"Daniel Boone","year":" 1969","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0057742"},{"title":"Journey to the Unknown","year":" 1969","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0062574"},{"title":"CBS Playhouse","year":" 1968","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0831400"},{"title":"Dr. Kildare","year":" 1965","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0054535"},{"title":"Death Valley Days","year":" 1962","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0044259"},{"title":"By Love Possessed","year":" 1961","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0054710"},{"title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents","year":" 1958-1960","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047708"},{"title":"Dow Hour of Great Mysteries","year":" 1960","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0227895"},{"title":"Cinq femmes marquées","year":" 1960","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0053561"},{"title":"Riverboat","year":" 1959","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0052506"},{"title":"The Five Pennies","year":" 1959","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0052809"},{"title":"The DuPont Show of the Month","year":" 1958","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0050013"},{"title":"The United States Steel Hour","year":" 1958","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0045449"},{"title":"Decision","year":" 1958","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0307738"},{"title":"Vertigo","year":" 1958","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0052357"},{"title":"Playhouse 90","year":" 1958","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0048893"},{"title":"Studio One in Hollywood","year":" 1957-1958","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0040051"},{"title":"Schlitz Playhouse","year":" 1957","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0043228"},{"title":"The Joseph Cotten Show: On Trial","year":" 1957","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0048892"},{"title":"Campbell Summer Soundstage","year":" 1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0044245"},{"title":"Fourteen Hours","year":" 1951","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0043560"},{"title":"Nash Airflyte Theatre","year":" 1950","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0042127"},{"title":"Pulitzer Prize Playhouse","year":" 1950","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0042138"},{"title":"Robert Montgomery Presents","year":" 1950","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0042141"},{"title":"Panic in the Streets","year":" 1950","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0042832"},{"title":"Caught","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040221"},{"title":"Blood on the Moon","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040175"},{"title":"I Remember Mama","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040458"},{"title":"The Long Night","year":" 1947","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039581"}]},{"section":"Soundtrack","filmography":[{"title":"I Remember Mama","year":" 1948","remarks":["(\"Listen to the Mockingbird\" (1855)",", uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0040458"}]},{"section":"Thanks","filmography":[{"title":"OT: Our Town","year":" 2002","remarks":["(Documentary)","(special thanks)"],"imdbid":"tt0334029"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Obsessed with Vertigo","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Short documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0192387"},{"title":"The 39th Annual Golden Globe Awards","year":" 1982","remarks":["(TV Special documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0355164"},{"title":"The 33rd Annual Primetime Emmy Awards","year":" 1981","remarks":["(TV Special)"],"imdbid":"tt0355161"},{"title":"The 7th Annual People's Choice Awards","year":" 1981","remarks":["(TV Special)"],"imdbid":"tt2120149"},{"title":"The 38th Annual Golden Globe Awards","year":" 1981","remarks":["(TV Special)"],"imdbid":"tt0343338"},{"title":"The 32nd Annual Primetime Emmy Awards","year":" 1980","remarks":["(TV Special)"],"imdbid":"tt0343337"},{"title":"The 37th Annual Golden Globe Awards","year":" 1980","remarks":["(TV Special)"],"imdbid":"tt0450954"},{"title":"The 6th People's Choice Awards","year":" 1980","remarks":["(TV Special)"],"imdbid":"tt2093048"},{"title":"The 31st Annual Primetime Emmy Awards","year":" 1979","remarks":["(TV Special)"],"imdbid":"tt0343336"},{"title":"The Ed Sullivan Show","year":" 1956","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0040053"},{"title":"A.N.T.A.
