In the 1940s she worked in radio. Her movie career was started with a bit part in the 1946 Miracle on 34th Street (1947). In the movie she played a weary Xmas shopper. Her performance in the short scene was noticed by Darryl F. Zanuck who insisted her role be expanded. During the period 1951 to 1963 Ms. Ritter was nominated for 6 Academy Awards. She is one of the most nominated actors who never won the statue. Shortly after a 1968 performance on The Jerry Lewis Show (1967), Ms. Ritter suffered a heart attack which proved fatal.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzOTEyNTUxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzAwNjYwNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0728812","name":"Thelma Ritter","idIMDB":"nm0728812","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"What's So Bad About Feeling Good?","year":" 1968","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0063799"},{"title":"The Incident","year":" 1967","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0061814"},{"title":"Boeing, Boeing","year":" 1965","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0058981"},{"title":"Move Over, Darling","year":" 1963","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0057329"},{"title":"A New Kind of Love","year":" 1963","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0057360"},{"title":"For Love or Money","year":" 1963","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0057067"},{"title":"How the West Was Won","year":" 1962","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0056085"},{"title":"Wagon Train","year":" 1962","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0050073"},{"title":"Birdman of Alcatraz","year":" 1962","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0055798"},{"title":"The Second Time Around","year":" 1961","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0055421"},{"title":"Frontier Circus","year":" 1961","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0054540"},{"title":"The Misfits","year":" 1961","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0055184"},{"title":"Startime","year":" 1960","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0052511"},{"title":"General Electric Theater","year":" 1960","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0045395"},{"title":"Pillow Talk","year":" 1959","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0053172"},{"title":"A Hole in the Head","year":" 1959","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0052896"},{"title":"Telephone Time","year":" 1957","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0048903"},{"title":"The United States Steel Hour","year":" 1957","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0045449"},{"title":"The Christophers","year":" 1956","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0408379"},{"title":"The Proud and Profane","year":" 1956","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0049640"},{"title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents","year":" 1956","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047708"},{"title":"The 20th Century-Fox Hour","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0047702"},{"title":"Lucy Gallant","year":" 1955","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0048318"},{"title":"The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0040049"},{"title":"Goodyear Playhouse","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0043204"},{"title":"Daddy Long Legs","year":" 1955","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0047969"},{"title":"The Best of Broadway","year":" 1955","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0046580"},{"title":"Lux Video Theatre","year":" 1954","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0042123"},{"title":"Rear Window","year":" 1954","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0047396"},{"title":"The Farmer Takes a Wife","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045752"},{"title":"Pickup on South Street","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0046187"},{"title":"Titanic","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0046435"},{"title":"With a Song in My Heart","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045333"},{"title":"The Model and the Marriage Broker","year":" 1951","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0043813"},{"title":"As Young as You Feel","year":" 1951","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0043299"},{"title":"The Mating Season","year":" 1951","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0043792"},{"title":"All About Eve","year":" 1950","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0042192"},{"title":"I'll Get By","year":" 1950","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0042589"},{"title":"Perfect Strangers","year":" 1950","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0042841"},{"title":"Father Was a Fullback","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041350"},{"title":"City Across the River","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041251"},{"title":"A Letter to Three Wives","year":" 1949","remarks":["Sadie Dugan (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0041587"},{"title":"Call Northside 777","year":" 1948","remarks":["Receptionist (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0040202"},{"title":"Miracle on 34th Street","year":" 1947","remarks":["(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0039628"}]},{"section":"Soundtrack","filmography":[{"title":"The Entertainers","year":" 1964","remarks":["(TV Series)","(performer -
