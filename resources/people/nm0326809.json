{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"28 May 1892","placeOfBirth":" Baltimore, Maryland, USA","bio":"A doctor's daughter, Minna Gombell had a successful career on the stage from 1912 to the end of the 1920's, appearing often in comedic roles, almost always in leads. She had a reputation as a fast learner, capable of reading and comprehending a script in a matter of hours. This ability served her well as an understudy early in her career. She made her Broadway debut in 1913 in 'Madam President' and later appeared in several productions of her stage director husband Myron C. Fagan (for instance,'Nancy's Private Affair',1930). Although Minna's specialty was street-wise, tough-talking blondes, she displayed quite a repertoire of varied characters during her movie career. She was best friend and steadying influence on Sally Eilers in Bad Girl (1931), a conflicted and unhappy mother in After Tomorrow (1932), the cold wife of The Thin Man (1934), a waspish wife in Babbitt (1934), brassy burlesque performers in Stepping Sisters (1932) and Comet Over Broadway (1938) and a tough nurse presiding over The Snake Pit (1948). She also had occasional leads, for instance as the gold-digger Stella in Bachelor's Affairs (1932), a comedy with Adolphe Menjou. An underrated and sadly, almost forgotten actress today, she enlivened many a film with her presence.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmQ5NGY3Y2YtMTZlMy00ZGFmLTk5YWMtODg0NDZkODExMzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0326809","name":"Minna
