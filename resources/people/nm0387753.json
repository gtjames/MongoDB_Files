{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"14 April 1917","placeOfBirth":" Larne, County Antrim, Ireland [now Northern Ireland], UK","birthName":"Valerie Babette Louise Hobson","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Elegant, quintessentially English (although born in Northern Ireland) Valerie Hobson was the daughter of a British army officer. She studied dancing at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA) and appeared on the stage for the first time at age 16, but she contracted a case of scarlet fever and decided to give up dancing for acting. She journeyed to Hollywood, but became disillusioned with the studio system and returned to Britain, where she was often cast in aristocratic roles. She married producer Anthony Havelock-Allan and subsequently appeared in many of his films, although the couple divorced in 1952. She then married politician--and future notorious sex-and-espionage-scandal figure--John Profumo and gave up her acting career. She stood strongly by Profume during that distasteful period, which became the biggest political scandal Britain has seen to date. In her later years she was devoted to her charity work with mentally handicapped children and lepers.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyOTg4NTEzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk4MDExOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0387753","name":"Valerie Hobson","idIMDB":"nm0387753","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Lovers, Happy Lovers!","year":" 1954","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0047243"},{"title":"Edge of Divorce","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045532"},{"title":"Murder Will Out","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0044931"},{"title":"Tonight at 8:30","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045243"},{"title":"The Passionate Sentry","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045011"},{"title":"The Promoter","year":" 1952","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045056"},{"title":"The Man of Destiny","year":" 1950","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt4548562"},{"title":"The Rocking Horse Winner","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0042898"},{"title":"The Interrupted Journey","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041511"},{"title":"Train of Events","year":" 1949","remarks":["Stella (segment \"The Composer\")"],"imdbid":"tt0041982"},{"title":"Kind Hearts and Coronets","year":" 1949","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0041546"},{"title":"The Hideout","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0040801"},{"title":"Blanche Fury","year":" 1948","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039195"},{"title":"Great Expectations","year":" 1946","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0038574"},{"title":"The Years Between","year":" 1946","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0039112"},{"title":"The Adventures of Tartu","year":" 1943","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0035612"},{"title":"Unpublished Story","year":" 1942","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0035494"},{"title":"Atlantic Ferry","year":" 1941","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0033358"},{"title":"Blackout","year":" 1940","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0032356"},{"title":"Shadows of the Underworld","year":" 1939","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0032026"},{"title":"The Spy in Black","year":" 1939","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0031968"},{"title":"Continental Express","year":" 1939","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0031924"},{"title":"Clouds Over Europe","year":" 1939","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0031831"},{"title":"This Man Is News","year":" 1938","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0032025"},{"title":"Drums","year":" 1938","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0030082"},{"title":"Henry IV","year":" 1938","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0250420"},{"title":"Pasquinade","year":" 1937","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0403404"},{"title":"When Thief Meets Thief","year":" 1937","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0029760"},{"title":"No Exit","year":" 1936","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0028034"},{"title":"Tugboat Princess","year":" 1936","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0028421"},{"title":"The Secret of Stamboul","year":" 1936","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0028233"},{"title":"August Week End","year":" 1936","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0027316"},{"title":"The Great Impersonation","year":" 1935","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0026438"},{"title":"Chinatown Squad","year":" 1935","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0026206"},{"title":"Werewolf of London","year":" 1935","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0027194"},{"title":"Bride of Frankenstein","year":" 1935","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0026138"},{"title":"Oh, What a Night","year":" 1935","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0026804"},{"title":"Rendezvous at Midnight","year":" 1935","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0026923"},{"title":"Mystery of Edwin Drood","year":" 1935","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0026758"},{"title":"Life Returns","year":" 1935","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0025391"},{"title":"The Man Who Reclaimed His Head","year":" 1934","remarks":["Mimi -
