Very funny, very creative and very thought provoking. His books often make you look at yourself in ways that you would never have before. Same goes for the world, he will make you notice things that you never did. He is of French and Russian descent but his last name is from Ukraine. He gained recognition with his first book \"Fight Club\" which was later made into a film by 20th Century Fox. He went on to gain popularity as his later novels which include Survivor, Invisible Monsters, Choke, Lullaby, and Haunted. More recently (2003) he has written a travel book about his hometown Portland, Oregon entitled \"Fugitives & Refugees\". His newest novel is entitled \"Rant\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4MjMyMjE3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODUxMzc1MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0657333","name":"Chuck Palahniuk","nicknames":["Chucky P"],"idIMDB":"nm0657333","filmographies":[{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"Snuff","year":" ","remarks":["(based on the novel by)"],"imdbid":"tt1773686"},{"title":"Fight Club: Copy of a Copy","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Short)","(based on characters from the novel by)"],"imdbid":"tt5943502"},{"title":"Romance","year":" 2012/II","remarks":["(Short)","(based on the short story by)"],"imdbid":"tt2378428"},{"title":"Pieces","year":" 2012/VIII","remarks":["(Short)","(novel)"],"imdbid":"tt3075674"},{"title":"Punch Drunk","year":" 2008","remarks":["(Video short)","(short story)"],"imdbid":"tt2113033"},{"title":"Choke","year":" 2008","remarks":["(novel)"],"imdbid":"tt1024715"},{"title":"Fight Club","year":" 2004","remarks":["(Video Game)","(characters)"],"imdbid":"tt0415800"},{"title":"Fight Club","year":" 1999","remarks":["(novel)"],"imdbid":"tt0137523"}]},{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Georgie's Big Break","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1831661"},{"title":"Choke","year":" 2008","remarks":["Passenger (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt1024715"}]},{"section":"Thanks","filmography":[{"title":"Absence","year":" 2009","remarks":["(thanks)"],"imdbid":"tt0824279"},{"title":"Choke","year":" 2008","remarks":["(the producers wish to thank)"],"imdbid":"tt1024715"},{"title":"Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)","(special thanks - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0475900"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Temple of Art","year":" 2017","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt3890144"},{"title":"Página 2","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1134965"},{"title":"Last Call with Carson Daly","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0305056"},{"title":"Up Close with Carrie Keagan","year":" 2008","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1434322"},{"title":"Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0475900"},{"title":"Le grand journal de Canal+","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0426701"},{"title":"HARDtalk Extra","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0413575"},{"title":"50 Films to See Before You Die","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0795328"},{"title":"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0437729"},{"title":"Postcards from the Future: The Chuck Palahniuk Documentary","year":" 2003","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0398273"},{"title":"Late Night with Conan O'Brien","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106052"}]}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/15 05:26:41"}}
