In over 110 fights against the greatest middleweights in history, LaMotta was only knocked to the canvas once in his entire 14 year career. Turning pro in the early 1940s, Lamotta ran up an impressive undefeated streak before losing. He was the first fighter to defeat the great Sugar Ray Robinson (Robinson was 40-0). Claimed to have \"taken a dive\" against \"Blackjack\" Billy Fox in New York City. Fox was 49-1 with 49 knockouts. Captured the World's Middleweight Title from the legendary Frenchman Marcel Cerdan. Made two successful title defenses. Was knocked down by light-heavyweight Danny Nardico in West Palm Beach, Florida in the early 1950s. Made an ill advised comeback and lost to Billy Kilgore in Miami Beach. Ran a popular nightclub on Miami Beach in the 1950s. Served a short prison term. Acted in the movie, The Hustler (1961) with Paul Newman.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3MzcxNjMyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI1ODExOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0483766","name":"Jake LaMotta","nicknames":["The Bronx Bull","Jack","The Raging Bull","Bronx Bull"],"idIMDB":"nm0483766","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Question d'honneur","year":" 1997","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0491462"},{"title":"The Happy Moose","year":" 1995","remarks":["(Short)","(voice, as The Evil Cat)"],"imdbid":"tt1495975"},{"title":"New Jack City","year":" 1991","remarks":["Gangster standing at bar.
