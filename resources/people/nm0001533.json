{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"27 September 1947","placeOfBirth":" Dallas, Texas, USA","birthName":"Marvin Lee Aday","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"Meat Loaf was born in Texas, and moved to Los Angeles in 1967 to play in local bands and appear in musicals such as \"Hair\" and \"As You Like It\". He made his film debut with a memorable role in cult film The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975). In 1977, he and lyricist Jim Steinman released an operatic rock album called \"Bat Out Of Hell\", the record was huge and has sold 35,000,000 copies worldwide. However, the tour promoting the album took a toll on Meat's voice and left him unable to sing on the follow-up record \"Bad For Good\". Meat Loaf stayed in the dark through the eighties doing 4 records which never got any airplay or chart position in the US. Meat Loaf appeared in films Out of Bounds (1986) as a Pilot, and The Squeeze (1987) with Michael Keaton. But after getting back together with Steinman, they delivered a powerful sequel \"Bat Out Of Hell II\" which went to #1 in the US and UK. Bat II has now sold an excess of 20,000,000 copies. His TV credits include the Soldier being held prisoner in Vietnam in Lightning Force (1991), a mad Doctor who invents a serum to keep zombies from deteriorating in Monsters (1988) and a slick Landlord of a restaurant who ends up on the menu in HBO series Tales from the Crypt (1989). Meat Loaf has also appeared in Crazy in Alabama (1999) and Fight Club (1999).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzNTQ4MjYyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzgwNTEzMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001533","name":"Meat Loaf","idIMDB":"nm0001533","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Meat Loaf: Going All the Way -
