Brought to America as a child, he had a brief acting career, before becoming one of the founders of the Group Theatre in 1931, directing a number of plays there. His greatest influence, however, was through the Actors Studio, where he became director in 1950. A proponent of \"method\" acting, which he adapted from the \"system\" brought to America by Konstantin Stanislavski's disciple--and Marlon Brando's mentor--Stella Adler, he influenced several generations of actors, from James Dean to Dustin Hoffman. Film audiences would know him best as gangster Hyman Roth in The Godfather: Part II (1974).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkzNDM2OTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg2MzY2OQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0833448","name":"Lee Strasberg","idIMDB":"nm0833448","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Skokie","year":" 1981","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0083090"},{"title":"Going in Style","year":" 1979","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0079219"},{"title":"Boardwalk","year":" 1979","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0078886"},{"title":"...and justice for all.","year":" 1979","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0078718"},{"title":"The Last Tenant","year":" 1978","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0077837"},{"title":"The Godfather: A Novel for Television","year":" 1977","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0809488"},{"title":"Le pont de Cassandra","year":" 1976","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0074292"},{"title":"The Godfather: Part II","year":" 1974","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0071562"},{"title":"China Venture","year":" 1953","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0045624"},{"title":"Parnell","year":" 1937","remarks":["Pat (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0029377"}]},{"section":"Miscellaneous Crew","filmography":[{"title":"Tempo","year":" 1965","remarks":["(TV Series)","(subject - 1 episode)"],"imdbid":"tt0249324"},{"title":"Somewhere in the Night","year":" 1946","remarks":["(dialogue director - uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0038965"},{"title":"Winged Victory","year":" 1944","remarks":["(dialogue director)"],"imdbid":"tt0037467"}]},{"section":"Director","filmography":[{"title":"Story with Two Endings","year":" 1945","remarks":["(Documentary short)"],"imdbid":"tt0187525"}]},{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"Somewhere in the Night","year":" 1946","remarks":["(adaptation)"],"imdbid":"tt0038965"}]},{"section":"Art director","filmography":[{"title":"The Three Sisters","year":" 1966","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0061092"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Biography","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0092322"},{"title":"American Masters","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0364151"},{"title":"Night of 100 Stars","year":" 1982","remarks":["(TV Special)"],"imdbid":"tt0355825"},{"title":"Acting: Lee Strasberg and the Actors Studio","year":" 1981","remarks":["(Documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0081978"},{"title":"Good Morning America","year":" 1981","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0072506"},{"title":"Film 2016","year":" 1980","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0192897"},{"title":"Old Friends...
