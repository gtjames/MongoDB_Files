{"data":{"names":[{"dateOfBirth":"28 September 1935","placeOfBirth":" Harrow, London, England, UK","bio":"Ronald Lacey was born on June 18, 1935 in the suburbs of London. He began his career in 1961 after a brief stint in the Royal service. He attended The London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts. His first notable performance was delivered at The Royal Court in 1962's \"Chips With Everything\". Lacey had an unusual pug look with beady eyes and cherub's cheeks which landed him repeatedly in bizarre roles on both stage and screen. However it was his unforgettable demonic smile and peculiar Peter Lorre mannerisms that would bring Lacey a short period of fame in Hollywood. After performing on British television throughout the 1960's and 1970's, Lacey finally landed the role for which these characteristics could be used to full advantage. In 1981 he was cast as the villainous Nazi henchman in 'Steven Spielberg' 's widescreen blockbuster Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) He followed this with a series of various villainous roles for the next five to six years: Firefox (1982) with 'Clint Eastwood', Sahara (1983) with Brooke Shields, and Kalidor - la légende du talisman (1985) with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Lacey turned in two hilarious cinematic performances in full drag (Disney's Trenchcoat (1983) with Margot Kidder from 1982 and Invitation to the Wedding (1983) from 1985 - in which he played a husband/wife couple!). Sadly his career began to wane in the late eighties and Lacey died in London of liver failure on May 15, 1991. A tremendous talent with great depth and many facets, Ronald Lacey will be remembered best for his small but significant role as the dapper yet psychotic Nazi in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MDk0ODI3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODI4MjU2MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0479951","name":"Ronald Lacey","nicknames":["Ronnie"],"idIMDB":"nm0479951","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Angely smerti","year":" 1993","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0166483"},{"title":"Landslide","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0104678"},{"title":"The Assassinator","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0819824"},{"title":"The Strauss Dynasty","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0101208"},{"title":"TECX","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098923"},{"title":"Haggard","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098816"},{"title":"Stalingrad","year":" 1990","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0174240"},{"title":"Face to Face","year":" 1990","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0099535"},{"title":"Valmont","year":" 1989","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0098575"},{"title":"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade","year":" 1989","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0097576"},{"title":"Bomber Harris","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Movie)","RAF Officer (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0310777"},{"title":"The Nightmare Years","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096665"},{"title":"Dawn of an Evil Millennium","year":" 1988","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0352274"},{"title":"Blind Justice","year":" 1988","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0296309"},{"title":"The Great Escape II: The Untold Story","year":" 1988","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0095252"},{"title":"Masterpiece Mystery","year":" 1988","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0080249"},{"title":"Manifesto","year":" 1988","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0097826"},{"title":"Jailbird Rock","year":" 1988","remarks":["Warden Bauman (as Ron Lacey)"],"imdbid":"tt0181604"},{"title":"The Ray Bradbury Theatre","year":" 1988","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0088591"},{"title":"Hard Cases","year":" 1988","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1130077"},{"title":"Bergerac","year":" 1988","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0081831"},{"title":"The Sign of Four","year":" 1987","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0685628"},{"title":"William Tell","year":" 1987","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0140731"},{"title":"Boon","year":" 1987","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0090400"},{"title":"Into the Darkness","year":" 1986","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt0137842"},{"title":"Unnatural Causes","year":" 1986","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0379150"},{"title":"The Lone Runner","year":" 1986","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0091425"},{"title":"Sky Bandits","year":" 1986","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0091963"},{"title":"Black-Adder II","year":" 1986","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0088484"},{"title":"Mad Mission 4: You Never Die Twice","year":" 1986","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0092268"},{"title":"Minder","year":" 1985","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0078657"},{"title":"Connie","year":" 1985","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0088499"},{"title":"Kalidor - la légende du talisman","year":" 1985","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0089893"},{"title":"La chair et le sang","year":" 1985","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0089153"},{"title":"Tangiers","year":" 1985","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0084763"},{"title":"C.A.T.S.
