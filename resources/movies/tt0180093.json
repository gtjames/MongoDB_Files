She spends most of her time watching TV, especially a particular self-help show. She has delusions of rising above her current dull existence by being a guest on that show. Her son, Harry (Jared Leto) is a junkie but along with his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) has visions of making it big by becoming a drug dealer. Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) could be fashion designer or artist but is swept along in Harry's drug-centric world. Meanwhile Sara has developed an addiction of her own. She desperately wants to lose weight and so goes on a crash course involving popping pills, pills which turn out to be very addictive and harmful to her mental state.","simplePlot":"The drug-induced utopias of four Coney Island people are shattered when their addictions run deep.","actors":[{"actorName":"Ellen Burstyn","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000995","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MjYxMDc3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzU3MDIz._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0000995","character":"Sara Goldfarb","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0003316","main":true},{"actorName":"Jared Leto","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001467","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjUwNDUzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDA4OTAzMTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0001467","character":"Harry Goldfarb","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0003313","main":true},{"actorName":"Jennifer Connelly","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000124","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTczNTgzODYyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjk4ODk4Mw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0000124","character":"Marion Silver","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0003312","main":true},{"actorName":"Marlon Wayans","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005541","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEwMDU2NDYyNTheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDYxNDYzMzg@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0005541","character":"Tyrone C.
