Vinz, a Jew, Saïd, an Arab, and Hubert, a black boxer, have grown up in these French suburbs where high levels of diversity coupled with the racist and oppressive police force have raised tensions to a critical breaking point. During the riots that took place a night before, a police officer lost his handgun in the ensuing madness, only to leave it for Vinz to find. Now, with a newfound means to gain the respect he deserves, Vinz vows to kill a cop if his friend Abdel dies in the hospital, due the beating he received while in police custody.","simplePlot":"24 hours in the lives of three young men in the French suburbs the day after a violent riot.","actors":[{"actorName":"Vincent Cassel","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001993","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1NDUzMzM5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY1OTYyOQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0001993","character":"Vinz","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0385344","main":true},{"actorName":"Hubert Koundé","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0468003","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0468003","character":"Hubert","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Saïd Taghmaoui","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0846548","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4OTc0NjkwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTcwOTgyNQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0846548","character":"Saïd","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Abdel Ahmed Ghili","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0315760","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0315760","character":"Abdel","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Solo","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0813217","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0813217","character":"Santo","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Joseph Momo","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0597384","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0597384","character":"Ordinary Guy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Héloïse Rauth","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0712205","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0712205","character":"Sarah","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Rywka Wajsbrot","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0906682","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0906682","character":"Vinz's Grandmother","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Olga Abrego","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0009318","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0009318","character":"Vinz's Aunt","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Laurent Labasse","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0479360","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0479360","character":"Cook","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Choukri Gabteni","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0300404","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0300404","character":"Saïd's Brother","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Nabil Ben Mhamed","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0069945","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0069945","character":"Boy Blague","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Benoît Magimel","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0536095","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNjYwNjc1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjc4ODIyOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0536095","character":"Benoît","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Médard Niang","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0629202","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0629202","character":"Médard","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Arash Mansour","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0543963","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0543963","character":"Arash","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"idIMDB":"tt0113247","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113247","rating":"8.1","rated":"NOT RATED","votes":"108,231","type":"Movie"}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/13 22:29:24"}}
