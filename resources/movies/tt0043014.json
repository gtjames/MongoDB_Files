While trying to escape from his creditors, he has a flat tire and parks his car in a decadent mansion in Sunset Boulevard. He meets the owner and former silent-movie star Norma Desmond, who lives alone wit her butler and driver Max von Mayerling. Norma is demented and believes she will return to the cinema industry, and is protected and isolated from the world by Max, who was his director and husband in the past and still loves her. Norma proposes Joe to move to the mansion and help her in writing a screenplay for her comeback to the cinema, and the small-time writer becomes her lover and gigolo. When Joe falls in love for the young aspirant writer Betty Schaefer, Norma becomes jealous and completely insane and her madness leads to a tragic end.","simplePlot":"A hack screenwriter writes a screenplay for a former silent-film star who has faded into Hollywood obscurity.","actors":[{"actorName":"William Holden","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000034","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODI2NzM4MzA3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODMxOTkxOA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0000034","character":"Joe Gillis","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009499","main":true},{"actorName":"Gloria Swanson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0841797","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NzIxOTUwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDM5MTI2._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0841797","character":"Norma Desmond","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009498","main":true},{"actorName":"Erich von Stroheim","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002233","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMTYwNTcyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzQ2MjI2._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0002233","character":"Max Von Mayerling","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009500","main":true},{"actorName":"Nancy Olson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0647970","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTczNTA4MjExN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTkyNTgxMw@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0647970","character":"Betty Schaefer","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009501","main":true},{"actorName":"Fred Clark","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0163939","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzM3ODc0OTgtZmZlNi00N2ZmLTgxNjktNmIwM2Q1Yzg0MDNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR4,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0163939","character":"Sheldrake","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009502","main":true},{"actorName":"Lloyd Gough","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0332221","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0332221","character":"Morino","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0186663","main":true},{"actorName":"Jack Webb","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0916131","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NjMxNzgwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDc5MzQ2._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0916131","character":"Artie Green","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0186664","main":true},{"actorName":"Franklyn Farnum","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0267916","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwOTU5Mzg0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzIzNjI1NDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0267916","character":"Undertaker","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0496243","main":true},{"actorName":"Larry J.
