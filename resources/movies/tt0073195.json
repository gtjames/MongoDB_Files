When new Sheriff Martin Brody discovers the remains of a shark attack victim, his first inclination is to close the beaches to swimmers. This doesn't sit well with Mayor Larry Vaughn and several of the local businessmen. Brody backs down to his regret as that weekend a young boy is killed by the predator. The dead boy's mother puts out a bounty on the shark and Amity is soon swamped with amateur hunters and fisherman hoping to cash in on the reward. A local fisherman with much experience hunting sharks, Quint, offers to hunt down the creature for a hefty fee. Soon Quint, Brody and Matt Hooper from the Oceanographic Institute are at sea hunting the Great White shark. As Brody succinctly surmises after their first encounter with the creature, they're going to need a bigger boat.","simplePlot":"A giant great white shark arrives on the shores of a New England beach resort and wreaks havoc with bloody attacks on swimmers, until a part-time sheriff teams up with a marine biologist and an old seafarer to hunt the monster down.","actors":[{"actorName":"Roy Scheider","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001702","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2ODY5ODg4OTdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDUzOTM3Nw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0001702","character":"Brody","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0313300","main":true},{"actorName":"Robert Shaw","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001727","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NzI3NTU2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTUzMjkyOA@@._V1_UY44_CR4,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0001727","character":"Quint","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002870","main":true},{"actorName":"Richard Dreyfuss","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000377","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMjIzMjM2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDAxMDY0Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0000377","character":"Matt Hooper","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0165770","main":true},{"actorName":"Lorraine Gary","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0308882","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNzM4OTI5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTMwMDA1OA@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0308882","character":"Ellen Brody","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002873","main":true},{"actorName":"Murray Hamilton","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0358069","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1MDkyNzM0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk1MTA1OA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0358069","character":"Mayor Larry Vaughn","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002874","main":true},{"actorName":"Carl Gottlieb","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0331956","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzYzMzMzOTIzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI3NDAzNjE@._V1_UY44_CR4,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0331956","character":"Meadows","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0175508","main":true},{"actorName":"Jeffrey Kramer","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0469552","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MTIwNjc1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTU0ODcwOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0469552","character":"Deputy Hendricks","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0175509","main":true},{"actorName":"Susan Backlinie","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0045681","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1MDc3MTkxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg0ODcwOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0045681","character":"Chrissie Watkins","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002879","main":true},{"actorName":"Jonathan Filley","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0277204","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0277204","character":"Cassidy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0175511","main":true},{"actorName":"Ted Grossman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0343722","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0343722","character":"Estuary Victim","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0034277","main":true},{"actorName":"Chris Rebello","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0714268","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0714268","character":"Michael Brody","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002866","main":true},{"actorName":"Jay Mello","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0578054","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0578054","character":"Sean Brody","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002875","main":true},{"actorName":"Lee Fierro","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0276444","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0276444","character":"Mrs. Kintner","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002882","main":true},{"actorName":"Jeffrey Voorhees","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0903386","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0903386","character":"Alex Kintner","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0034278","main":true},{"actorName":"Craig Kingsbury","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0455475","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0455475","character":"Ben Gardner","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002883","main":true}],"idIMDB":"tt0073195","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073195","rating":"8.0","metascore":"86","rated":"PG","votes":"428,588","type":"Movie"}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/13 22:24:34"}}
