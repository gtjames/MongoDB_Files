Like any good mother, Ma dedicates herself to keeping Jack happy and safe, nurturing him with warmth and love and doing typical things like playing games and telling stories. Their life, however, is anything but typical--they are trapped--confined to a 10-by-10-foot space that Ma has euphemistically named Room. Ma has created a whole universe for Jack within Room, and she will stop at nothing to ensure that, even in this treacherous environment, Jack is able to live a complete and fulfilling life. But as Jack's curiosity about their situation grows, and Ma's resilience reaches its breaking point, they enact a risky plan to escape, ultimately bringing them face-to-face with what may turn out to be the scariest thing yet: the real world.","simplePlot":"A young boy is raised within the confines of a small shed.","actors":[{"actorName":"Brie Larson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0488953","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MzAxOTI5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzMzNTA4NjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0488953","character":"Ma","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0520994","main":true},{"actorName":"Jacob Tremblay","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5016878","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQzODIwNDMzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzkxMjYwNzE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm5016878","character":"Jack","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0520997","main":true},{"actorName":"Sean Bridgers","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0108703","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwNDQ5NjkwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjk3NTcyNA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0108703","character":"Old Nick","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0526979","main":true},{"actorName":"Wendy Crewson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0187724","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzNTc0Njc3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTczMDY0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0187724","character":"Talk Show Hostess","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0528584","main":true},{"actorName":"Sandy McMaster","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3223622","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm3223622","character":"Veteran","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Matt Gordon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330438","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1NDg2MjU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTkyMjYxOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0330438","character":"Doug","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Amanda Brugel","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0115760","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NjEzMDI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk1MjkwMDI@._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0115760","character":"Officer Parker","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Joe Pingue","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0684187","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5MTMyMDA3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDUwMTYxMDI@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0684187","character":"Officer Grabowski","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Joan Allen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000260","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1MjIwNTk5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA2MzQxMw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0000260","character":"Nancy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0520995","main":true},{"actorName":"Zarrin Darnell-Martin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4523607","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjUzNzA0MjcwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNDYxMjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm4523607","character":"Attending Doctor","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Cas Anvar","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0031679","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxMjI2OTIwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk4MTEyMDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0031679","character":"Dr. Mittal","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"William H.
