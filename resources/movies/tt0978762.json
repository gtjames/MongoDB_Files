She's Mary Dinkle, the only child of an alcoholic mother and a distracted father. He's Max Horowitz, an overweight man with Asperger's, living alone in New York. He writes back, with chocolate. Thus begins a 20-year correspondence, interrupted by a stay in an asylum and a few misunderstandings. Mary falls in love with a neighbor, saves money to have a birthmark removed and deals with loss. Max has a friendship with a neighbor, tries to control his weight, and finally gets the dream job. Will the two ever meet face to face?","simplePlot":"A tale of friendship between two unlikely pen pals: Mary, a lonely, eight-year-old girl living in the suburbs of Melbourne, and Max, a forty-four-year old, severely obese man living in New York.","actors":[{"actorName":"Toni Collette","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001057","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwNDU0MjQ3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzgwMjMxMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0001057","character":"Mary Daisy Dinkle","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0130153","main":true},{"actorName":"Philip Seymour Hoffman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000450","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0NTA1NTg3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzkxNzgxNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0000450","character":"Max Jerry Horovitz","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0137003","main":true},{"actorName":"Barry Humphries","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0402032","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3Mjk5NDI4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg4NjUzOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0402032","character":"Narrator","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Eric Bana","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0051509","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjcxMzI4OWItN2Y4NS00NDZjLWE3MDEtNTIwYWQyZjdiYjE2L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzAxOTAyMDc@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0051509","character":"Damien","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0137004","main":true},{"actorName":"Bethany Whitmore","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2512626","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NjAyMjEyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTUxMDU0MDI@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm2512626","character":"Young Mary","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0130153","main":true},{"actorName":"Ren√©e Geyer","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0315417","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0315417","character":"Vera","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0165918","main":true},{"actorName":"Ian 'Molly' Meldrum","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0577513","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0577513","character":"Homeless Man","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0454725","main":true},{"actorName":"Julie Forsyth","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0287054","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0287054","character":"Additional Voices","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"John Flaus","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281313","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0281313","character":"Additional Voices","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Christopher Massey","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1814260","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2Mzg3NTEzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODc2MDIzMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm1814260","character":"Additional Voices","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Shaun Patten","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1993815","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm1993815","character":"Additional Voices","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Carolyn Shakespeare-Allen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3410610","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm3410610","character":"Additional Voices","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Leanne Smith","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2037506","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODY5NjI4NDM4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE3NjM2OTE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm2037506","character":"Additional Voices","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"idIMDB":"tt0978762","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0978762","rating":"8.2","rated":"NOT RATED","votes":"124,750","type":"Movie"}]},"about":{"version":"2.26.6","serverTime":"2017/01/13 22:33:29"}}
