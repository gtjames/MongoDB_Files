Their instinct is to sabotage the bridge but, under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson, they are persuaded that the bridge should be constructed as a symbol of British morale, spirit and dignity in adverse circumstances. At first, the prisoners admire Nicholson when he bravely endures torture rather than compromise his principles for the benefit of the Japanese commandant Saito. He is an honorable but arrogant man, who is slowly revealed to be a deluded obsessive. He convinces himself that the bridge is a monument to British character, but actually is a monument to himself, and his insistence on its construction becomes a subtle form of collaboration with the enemy. Unknown to him, the Allies have sent a mission into the jungle, led by Warden and an American, Shears, to blow up the bridge.","simplePlot":"After settling his differences with a Japanese PoW camp commander, a British colonel co-operates to oversee his men's construction of a railway bridge for their captors - while oblivious to a plan by the Allies to destroy it.","actors":[{"actorName":"William Holden","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000034","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODI2NzM4MzA3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODMxOTkxOA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0000034","character":"Shears","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0219015","main":true},{"actorName":"Alec Guinness","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000027","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxMTA5OTI2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjEwNjU2._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0000027","character":"Colonel Nicholson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0219237","main":true},{"actorName":"Jack Hawkins","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0370144","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0MTk0NzI5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI1NjQwOA@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0370144","character":"Major Warden","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0219240","main":true},{"actorName":"Sessue Hayakawa","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0370564","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDQyMTkzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA2ODU2._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0370564","character":"Colonel Saito","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0219243","main":true},{"actorName":"James Donald","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0232019","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5Mjc3OTYzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTA0MTYxOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0232019","character":"Major Clipton","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0219249","main":true},{"actorName":"Geoffrey Horne","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0395012","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2UwMDc1YTMtYTNlZS00NjFlLTgwYzctOWRhMGIyNzI3YTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0395012","character":"Lieutenant Joyce","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0219250","main":true},{"actorName":"André Morell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0603682","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTk5Njc4OTAwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg0NDMxOA@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0603682","character":"Colonel Green","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0219253","main":true},{"actorName":"Peter Williams","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0931463","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0931463","character":"Captain Reeves","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0219255","main":true},{"actorName":"John Boxer","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0101533","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0101533","character":"Major Hughes","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0219257","main":true},{"actorName":"Percy Herbert","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0378612","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTAyODE5NjA4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzgwMDExOA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0378612","character":"Grogan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0219270","main":true},{"actorName":"Harold Goodwin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0329468","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0329468","character":"Baker","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0219273","main":true},{"actorName":"Ann Sears","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0780741","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NDY2MjY5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY3Nzk1MDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","actorId":"nm0780741","character":"Nurse","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0219297","main":true},{"actorName":"Heihachirô Ôkawa","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0645537","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0645537","character":"Captain Kanematsu","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0219265","main":true},{"actorName":"Keiichirô Katsumoto","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0441545","urlPhoto":"","actorId":"nm0441545","character":"Lieutenant Miura","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0219262","main":true},{"actorName":"M.R.B.
